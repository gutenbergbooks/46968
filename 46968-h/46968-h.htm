<h1 title="">THE BOY SCOUTS ON WAR TRAILS IN BELGIUM.</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">THE NEWS THAT REACHED THE RHINE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It strikes me Allan&rsquo;s a pretty long time coming
with those letters, Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! perhaps he&rsquo;s struck some exciting news
worth picking up; you know he&rsquo;s a correspondent
for a newspaper at home in the good old United
States, and must always be on the lookout for
happenings. Have a little more patience, Bumpus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see I didn&rsquo;t sleep ten winks last night,
Thad. After our lovely quiet trip down the Rhine
by boat from Mainz this place seemed just as noisy
as any boiler factory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder, Bumpus, with trains pouring in
from the east and north, every one loaded down
with German first-line troops, field artillery, cavalry
horses, aeroplane supplies, and all sorts of war
toggery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but, Giraffe, I took notice that <i>you</i> slept
like a top through it all, just as if we were camping
again in the Maine woods, or down in that Louisiana
swamp where we had such a roaring good
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy who answered to the peculiar nick-name
of &ldquo;Giraffe&rdquo; laughed when the stout, auburn-haired
member of the trio, known as Bumpus Hawtree,
made this assertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ve got it down to a fine point, Bumpus,&rdquo;
he remarked with a touch of boyish pride in his
voice; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found out how to make mind win over
matter. When I lay me down to sleep I just tell
myself to forget all troubles; and after counting
a hundred sheep jumping over a fence I lose myself
the finest way you ever saw. Try it yourself,
Bumpus, and see how it works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a rule I don&rsquo;t have any trouble getting my
forty winks, and you know that, Giraffe,&rdquo; the fat
boy continued, sadly; &ldquo;but just now I&rsquo;m terribly
worried about my mother back there in Antwerp.
Whatever would she do if this war does break out,
so helpless to get away by herself, because of that
paralysis she&rsquo;s trying to have cured by a specialist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve given you our promise, Bumpus,&rdquo; said
the one called Thad, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;d stick by you through
thick and thin, and do everything in our power to
get to Antwerp. So cherk up and try to feel that
it&rsquo;s all going to come out right in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, a scout never had a better chum than
you&rsquo;ve always been to me,&rdquo; Bumpus acknowledged,
with a trace of tears in his eyes, as he laid his
hand on the other&rsquo;s khaki sleeve; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to
do my level best to see the silver lining of the
cloud. But it&rsquo;s tough being hemmed in by a whole
army like we are, and given to understand that it&rsquo;s
impossible to enter Belgium again until the skies
clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These three boys who wore the well-known uniform
of scouts were seated in a boat that had apparently
been used as a means for descending the
historic Rhine.</p>
<p>Thad Brewster was the leader of the patrol to
which the others belonged. It was known as the
Silver Fox, and formed a part of Cranford Troop.
He had worked his way up until his field of experience
was so broad that it entitled him to take
the place of the regular scout master of the troop
when the latter could not accompany the boys on
their outings.</p>
<p>Giraffe was really known to his teachers in school
as Conrad Stedman. His ancestors had come from
this same Rhine country long ago, and as the boy
had made a specialty of German in school he was
able to jabber fairly well during their trip down
the beautiful river. Giraffe came by his nick-name
honestly. He had been given an abnormally long
neck by a bountiful Nature, and on occasion it
seemed as if the boy could even stretch this out to
an astonishing extent, just as the giraffe does. He
never complained because every one of his mates
called him by such a name, for if it hadn&rsquo;t been
that he must surely have been dubbed &ldquo;Rubber-neck,&rdquo;
which would have been infinitely worse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Bumpus Hawtree also had another more dignified
name, that of Cornelius Jasper, but it was utterly
unknown among his comrades. Whether on
the baseball field, in camp, on the trail, in a boat,
or any other place where boys might gather it was
always plain Bumpus. No one knew exactly why
that peculiar name had been given to the fat boy,
except that being clumsy he was always stumbling
into trouble, and given to bumping against his
chums.</p>
<p>These boys, with some others connected with
the Cranford Troop of scouts, had seen considerable
in the way of adventure since the first day they
organized their Silver Fox Patrol. Wonderful opportunities
had come to them whereby they were
allowed to visit the Blue Ridge country down in
North Carolina; go to the Maine woods on an outing;
cross the continent to the great Rockies and
enjoy a hunt for big game in the wilderness; and
even take a trip down into the Sunny South, where
amidst the swamps of Louisiana they had encountered
numerous remarkable adventures.</p>
<p>No matter what difficulties beset them, Thad
Brewster and his chums had always met emergencies
as became true-hearted scouts, and as a rule
managed to emerge from the encounter in triumph.
Earlier in the same summer that we see them so far
away from their home town of Cranford they had
been concerned in a wonderful hunt for a valuable
missing paper that took them along the banks of
the Susquehanna River, and brought them in contact
with a number of thrilling happenings, all of
which have been fully described in the volume preceding
this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>Bumpus Hawtree&rsquo;s father was the president of
the bank, and known to be a wealthy man. The
boy&rsquo;s mother had suffered from a paralytic stroke,
and urged to go abroad to be treated by an eminent
specialist, this trip had suddenly been thrust upon
the chums.</p>
<p>Circumstances having arisen whereby Mr. Hawtree
could not leave his business, he had entrusted
the care of the invalid to Bumpus, and even agreed
to stand for half of the expense of having his three
comrades accompany him.</p>
<p>Thad and Allan Hollister had long hoped to some
day take a boat trip down the Rhine, and when
they learned that Bumpus was going this fever had
attacked them more furiously than ever. Then came
Giraffe with the suggestion that he join with them,
making a party of four.</p>
<p>It proved to be an irresistible temptation. If
Mrs. Hawtree had to remain for a month or so at
the sanitarium of the specialist in Antwerp what
was to hinder the four chums from carrying out
their cherished scheme?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>At that time there seemed to be no cloud on the
sky of European politics. Servia had indeed put
a match under the magazine when some scoundrel
assassinated the heir to the Austrian throne, and
the Dual Monarchy was demanding redress; but
nearly every one supposed it would end in Servia
backing completely down, and doing whatever her
big neighbor insisted upon.</p>
<p>So the trip had been made, the invalid left comfortably
in the Belgian city on the Scheldt, after
which the quartette of wide-awake American boys
hurried across to the German city of Mainz, where
they managed to hire a boat that would answer
their purposes.</p>
<p>This was fixed up the best way possible for
cruising, and they had taken their own good time
drifting down the beautiful Rhine. At night when
away from any city or town the boys would proceed
to camp just as though they were over in
America, and navigating the waters of the Mississippi
or the Susquehanna.</p>
<p>It would perhaps take a book to tell of the many
interesting things they saw and experienced while
on this voyage along the German waterway. The
task would be a most pleasant one, too; but there
are too many more stirring scenes lying ahead of
Thad and his friends and awaiting our immediate
attention to linger here.</p>
<p>Bumpus had been greatly worried of late. The
reports had grown more and more serious the nearer
they approached Cologne, and evidences multiplied
that went to tell them the great German nation was
taking no chances of a sudden invasion from the
French border.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>They had seen trainloads of soldiers all sweeping
toward the west and south. Heavy traction engines
had been noticed moving slowly along country
roads, and drawing enormous guns behind them.
Thousands of motor trucks, each also loaded to the
limit with men in helmets, had been seen scurrying
along.</p>
<p>All these things pointed to a growing fear that
some terrible calamity was impending over poor
Europe, so that possibly the long talked of World&rsquo;s
War might be nearer than most people across the
Atlantic dreamed of.</p>
<p>To comfort Bumpus, Thad had solemnly promised
him that no matter what happened they would
do everything in their power to forge ahead and
reach Antwerp. When he made that brotherly
promise Thad could not have foreseen one-tenth
of the tremendous difficulties that would have to
be surmounted before it could ever be carried into
execution; but once it was given he had such a
tenacious will that the leader of the Silver Fox
Patrol was bound to try and keep his word.</p>
<p>Their other comrade, Allan Hollister, had gone
into the city for any mail that might be awaiting
their arrival at Cologne. Sitting there with the
magnificent twin spires of the famous cathedral in
plain sight, the others were impatiently awaiting
his return.</p>
<p>It may have been ten minutes after the little talk
occurred with which this chapter opens that a boy
was discovered hurrying toward the boat. From
the fact of his wearing a khaki suit like the ones
Thad and his other two chums sported, it could be
set down for granted that this must be Allan Hollister.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>As he drew nearer, all of them could see that his
face was grave. This gave Bumpus a new pang,
for he feared he would never be able to make
the journey across Belgium, and join his invalid
mother, who would be waiting for him in Antwerp.</p>
<p>Allan silently handed each of them some mail, but
after a glance at his Thad voiced the feelings of
his other two allies when he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re bringing us bad news, Allan; it&rsquo;s written
on your face, and there&rsquo;s no use keeping it back
any longer. What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allan was the second in control of the patrol, a
good woodsman, and a stout-hearted scout. He
braced himself with an effort, and after drawing a
big breath went on to tell them the thrilling news he
had heard when getting the mail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The war is on&mdash;German armies have crossed
the frontier into Belgium&mdash;King Albert has refused
to let them pass through his country, and
there is a terrible battle being fought at Li&eacute;ge,
with thousands of men killed and wounded on both
sides. The whole of Germany and Austria have
flamed up, and it&rsquo;s going to be a fight to the death
with the biggest nations of Europe on the battle
line!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">A BOLD UNDERTAKING.</span></h2>
<p>No one said anything immediately. Bumpus had
turned very white, and a pained expression crept
across his round face, seldom seen there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor mother!&rdquo; they heard him mutter, as
he stared over into the mysterious west, in the direction
where Antwerp was supposed to lie, with
part of Germany and the whole of Belgium between.</p>
<p>Under ordinary conditions there would have
been only one way out of the scrape for the four
chums. This would have been to make as rapid
a retreat as they could, passing further into Germany,
and managing by some good fortune to get
over into Holland where at Amsterdam they might
secure passage to London by steamer.</p>
<p>Thad would have laid out their campaign along
those lines only for his sacred promise to poor
Bumpus, who being very set in his way might have
attempted the task of getting to the Belgian city
by himself, and of course making an utter failure
of it, because Bumpus never did many things right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, the worst has come, after all,&rdquo; said Thad,
presently; &ldquo;and the torch has been put to the powder
magazine that will blow up pretty much all
Europe before the end is reached.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will Great Britain fight, do you think, Thad?&rdquo;
asked Giraffe, in somewhat of an awed voice for
one so bold as he had usually proved himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to be seen,&rdquo; replied the other, gravely;
&ldquo;but we know that France and Russia will fly to
arms, and I don&rsquo;t see how England can keep out
of it. You know she has sworn to maintain the
neutrality of Belgium even by force of arms if
necessary. If the German army is over the border
that settles it, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! but there will be a fierce old row!&rdquo; declared
Giraffe; &ldquo;and just to think of our being
over here at such a wonderful time. Mebbe we
won&rsquo;t have lots to tell Step Hen, Davy Jones,
Smithy, Bob White, and the rest of the fellows
when we get back home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when we do!&rdquo; echoed Bumpus, dolefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, cheer up, Bumpus; don&rsquo;t look like you&rsquo;d
lost your last friend,&rdquo; the boy with the long neck
told him. &ldquo;Remember what Thad said about our
hanging to you all the way through, don&rsquo;t you?
Well, it still goes. Even the whole German army
can&rsquo;t keep us from getting over into Belgium, and
hiking for old Antwerp. We&rsquo;ll pull up there sooner
or later in pretty fair shape, and smuggle Ma Hawtree
across the Channel to England&rsquo;s shores, mark
my words if we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad and Allan both said something along the
same lines. Perhaps they may not have felt quite
so sanguine as Giraffe, but that did not prevent
them from trying to bolster up the sagging courage
of Bumpus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Of course the latter began to show immediate
signs of renewed hope. How could it be otherwise
when he had the backing of such loyal chums?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can we do when the whole country
is just swarming with soldiers, all heading in the
direction of the border?&rdquo; Bumpus wanted to know.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got our passports, I admit, but in time of
war they wouldn&rsquo;t be worth the paper they&rsquo;re written
on. And, Thad, no common person can ride
on one of the trains these days, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right, Bumpus,&rdquo; the other admitted,
&ldquo;and in making up our plans we must omit travel
in the regular way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The border is something like forty miles away
from here, I should say,&rdquo; suggested Allan, who
had of course looked the thing up on the map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Netherlands a bit closer,&rdquo; Thad explained,
&ldquo;if we chose to cross over the line; but
we might find it hard to get into Belgium that way.
One thing sure, we must be on the move to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean we&rsquo;ll hoof it, Thad?&rdquo; demanded
Giraffe, who, being a good walker, evidently did
not see any particular difficulty about managing
twenty to thirty miles a day over good summer
roads.</p>
<p>With Bumpus it was quite another matter, and
he held his breath while waiting to hear what the
patrol leader had to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we have to we might make it,&rdquo; Thad presently
returned, as though he had considered the matter
himself at some previous time. &ldquo;Then who knows
but what we might be lucky enough to run across
some man owning a car, who would either rent it
to us or give us a lift to the border.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Thad,&rdquo; objected Allan, &ldquo;you know what
we heard about all cars? As soon as the order for
mobilization went out it was flashed from the Russian
border to Alsace and Lorraine, and from that
minute every car worth owning in the entire German
country would be the property of the Government.
Why, if we owned even an American-made
car right now it would be taken away from
us, to be paid for by the military authorities. I&rsquo;m
afraid it&rsquo;s going to be a case of shank&rsquo;s mare with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it,&rdquo; said Thad; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to make a start
inside of an hour or so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the prompt way in which most of the
matters engineered by Thad Brewster were put
through. Somehow his manner of saying it thrilled
the others, for there could be seen a new grim look
come into their faces. Even the woe-begone countenance
of Bumpus took on fresh hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean that we&rsquo;re going to start
out into the west, Thad?&rdquo; he asked, with glistening
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what we&rsquo;ll do, Bumpus!&rdquo; he was told with
a reassuring smile on the part of the patrol leader
such as always carried fresh cheer to anxious hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about getting rid of the boat that&rsquo;s carried
us down the Rhine so splendidly?&rdquo; questioned
Giraffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s already been arranged for,&rdquo; was what the
other told him; &ldquo;all we have to do is to hand it over
to that boat builder, and get his receipt for the
same. We have paid the last thaler we owe, and
there&rsquo;s no reason why we can&rsquo;t leave our duffle here
with the same man, to be sent for later on when
the war is over and railroads are taking on freight
again for America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds good to me,&rdquo; said Giraffe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate
to lose a few things I brought along to make myself
comfortable with&mdash;the red blanket, for instance,
that&rsquo;s been with me on so many camping
trips. I hope there&rsquo;s a good chance of seeing our
stuff again some fine day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, talking isn&rsquo;t going to help us any, so what
do you say we get busy?&rdquo; suggested Thad; and as
the others were all agreeable they soon made quick
work with packing up their belongings, so they
could be left in charge of the owner of the boatyard
on the outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>All the while they worked the boys could hear a
thousand and one sounds connected with the feverish
rush of military trains crossing bridges, and
starting off anew toward the Belgian border at three
points beyond the mobilizing centre of Aachen or,
as it was once called, Aix la Chappelle, almost due
west by south from Cologne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>When the hour was up they had accomplished all
the preliminaries looking to the start on foot across
German territory. The owner of the boatyard
doubtless wondered what they meant to do, for he
asked a number of curious questions. Still he
readily agreed to store their packages until such
time as he received instructions how to ship the
same to America, accompanied by a tidy little sum
to pay his charges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you asked my opinion,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe,
after they had left the place and started off, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
say that old chap didn&rsquo;t wholly believe the story
we told. Right now he may think we&rsquo;re really a
party of British Boy Scouts, over here in the land
of the Kaiser to learn some of the garrison secrets,
so in case of an invasion later on the beefeaters
would know where the weak places in the defences
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he would go to the trouble to inform
some of the military authorities of his suspicions,
and get them after us?&rdquo; asked Bumpus,
looking concerned, as well he might, for every
delay promised to make his task of rejoining his
ailing mother more difficult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope not,&rdquo; said Thad; &ldquo;but these Germans
certainly do have the greatest secret service ever
known. They get their news in a thousand ways,
I&rsquo;ve heard; and this war is going to give the world
the biggest surprise it ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Thad made that remark he little knew
what wonderful things were fated to come to light
connected with the spy system of Germany, which
would prove to be the most elaborate ever conceived
by any nation, modern or otherwise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Next to Americans, they&rsquo;re the most wonderful
people under the sun!&rdquo; boldly declared Giraffe,
whose ancestors had lived along that same Rhine
river, so that he could not help but feel very kindly
toward the whole Teuton race.</p>
<p>There was Bumpus who was on the other side of
the fence, for the Hawtrees came of good old
English stock. Hence he and Giraffe often had
friendly little tilts, each standing up for the land
from which his ancestors sprang. That little remark
about the &ldquo;beefeaters&rdquo; was meant as a sort
of sly slur at Bumpus by the boy with the long
neck, though for once it failed to arouse any comment.</p>
<p>Having been compelled to pass the city in order
to find the boatyard to which they had been directed,
the boys were on the northern side of Cologne at
the time they began their long tramp. Little did
they dream what amazing incidents were fated to
fall to their portion before that journey came to
an end. It would have thrilled them through and
through could they have guessed even one-half of
the hardships and the adventures that awaited them
on their bold undertaking.</p>
<p>With small bundles thrown over their shoulders
after the manner of scouts&rsquo; knapsacks, they left the
river behind them and faced the west.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve enjoyed meeting you, Old Father Rhine,&rdquo;
said Giraffe, waving his hand toward the stream
as though he looked on it as a very good friend,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll always keep a little corner of our memory
sacred to this glorious trip; but we&rsquo;ve got something
to handle now that&rsquo;s a heap more serious than just
loafing in a pleasure boat, and eating three square
meals a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;we might pin the little
miniature American flags we brought with us to
our coat lapels. Then folks can see that we are
Yankees, and not Britishers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t run across much bad feeling
for the English among the Germans,&rdquo; Bumpus ventured
to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! wait and see what happens if Great Britain
dares to take up the challenge the Kaiser&rsquo;s
thrown down when he crossed the Belgian border,&rdquo;
asserted Giraffe. &ldquo;The first shot a British man-o&rsquo;-war
takes at a German vessel and it&rsquo;s going to
be unsafe to talk in English over here. You&rsquo;ll even
have to change that snore of yours, Bumpus, and
give it a Dutch twist. Now if your name was only
Gottlieb you&rsquo;d pass for a native easy enough, with
your red face and round figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus chatting they made their way along the
road leading away from the city to the cathedral.
Many persons they chanced to meet gave them a
respectful salute, no doubt at first thinking they
might belong to one of the German troops of Boy
Scouts so common all over the empire. When they
glimpsed those tiny flags which the four lads so
proudly wore, their eyebrows went up and they
were noticed to say things in an undertone, one to
another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>On several occasions Thad thought it best for
them to step off the road and settle down in some
fence corner, or under a shed it might be. Each
of these times there passed a company of soldiers
hurrying toward the city, and evidently making
for a mobilization point so that they might occupy
a place previously arranged for in the grand concentration
scheme of the nation&rsquo;s army.</p>
<p>These delays were not numerous, but they served
to hold the boys up more or less, so that by the
time noon came they had not covered more than
three miles of territory beyond the suburbs of Cologne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a ramshackle old car stalled over yonder,&rdquo;
Thad announced about this time, &ldquo;and I
propose that we see if anything can be done to
hire or buy it. All good cars are seized by the
military on sight, but they&rsquo;d pass such a wreck by.
If we find we can repair it, and can get even five
miles an hour out of the machine, it&rsquo;d be our policy
to commandeer it, if our pocketbook will stand
the strain.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">GIRAFFE MAKES A BARGAIN.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff, Thad,&rdquo; declared Bumpus, enthusiastically.</p>
<p>No one considered this an odd remark for the
stout boy to make, because they knew from past
experience that he was not an ardent pedestrian.
Bumpus was not built for action along those lines;
he &ldquo;het up&rdquo; too easily, as he was fond of explaining,
and even now could be seen mopping his perspiring
brow with his bandanna handkerchief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>The man with the disabled car was so busily engaged
that he did not notice the approach of the
four chums until they reached the spot. Apparently
he was about ready to give it up as a bad
job, for he scratched his head helplessly, and had
a look of utter chagrin on his face as he turned toward
them.</p>
<p>Thad had previously asked Giraffe to conduct the
negotiations, using his best German to produce results.</p>
<p>The man was apparently some small tradesman
in one of the towns so thickly scattered about that
region. He stared hard at the boys, understanding
immediately that they had a foreign look. Still the
Rhine country attracted many thousands of pilgrims
each year, and myriads of honest people helped out
their living by what the tourists left behind them;
so he must have been used to seeing strangers.</p>
<p>Perhaps the news that had reached his ears concerning
the breaking out of war may have been
the cause of his puzzled look.</p>
<p>While Giraffe engaged him in conversation, the
others took a look at the engine of the car. Both
Thad and Allan had a fair smattering of mechanical
knowledge, and it did not take them long to
size the situation up, as the latter termed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;An old rattlebox, sure enough, Thad,&rdquo; observed
Allan, knowing that the owner could not very well
understand what he was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a few worse machines, but I believe
I could count them on the fingers of one hand,&rdquo;
the patrol leader admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to see what the matter is, though the
man doesn&rsquo;t seem to know,&rdquo; was what Allan remarked
next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and so far as that goes it can be remedied
without a great amount of time and trouble,&rdquo; continued
Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it pay us to make an offer for the discard?&rdquo;
asked Bumpus, anxious to have a little say
in the matter.</p>
<p>The other two exchanged looks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take another squint at the thing before we
decide,&rdquo; remarked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; his chum added. &ldquo;I never did like to
buy a pig in a poke, as they used to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more they examined the engine, and then
took a look at each of the pretty well-used tires.
Meanwhile Giraffe had exhausted his vocabulary,
and both he and the old German owner of the
stranded car stood and watched what the others
were doing.</p>
<p>Bumpus bustled around like a busy beaver. From
the way he poked his head under the hood of the
machine, touched this part of the machinery and
then that, one would have thought he might be an
experienced mechanic; and yet what Bumpus did
not know about such things would fill many volumes.
But then it pleased him to look wise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ask him if he cared to sell the old trap,
Giraffe?&rdquo; questioned Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the other scout replied, &ldquo;I put it up to
him, and he told me he didn&rsquo;t care if he did, providing
he could get his price, and that it was in
cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cash part we could meet easily enough,&rdquo;
continued the scout leader, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d want to know
what sort of a price he means to put on the wreck.
It&rsquo;s of little use to him as it stands, for he can&rsquo;t do
a thing with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him so,&rdquo; said Giraffe, &ldquo;and that if we
chose to buy the car it would only be to have a
little fun out of it, and then throw the old tub in
the discard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only fit for the scrap heap,&rdquo; ventured Bumpus,
pompously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, get him to set a price on it, spot cash, and
if it&rsquo;s too high we&rsquo;ll step out with shank&rsquo;s mare
again,&rdquo; Thad told the negotiator.</p>
<p>Accordingly Giraffe brushed up his high-school
German and set to work. The man listened to what
he was saying, nodding his head meanwhile. His
eyes had a cunning look in them Thad thought, that
seemed to tell of covetousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; they heard Giraffe say in an explosive
way, after the other had committed himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is his lowest figure in cash?&rdquo; asked Thad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He nearly took my breath away,&rdquo; declared the
other; &ldquo;actually asks five hundred marks for an old
trap like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s highway robbery, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; commented
Bumpus, in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says all the decent cars are being taken over
by the military authorities,&rdquo; continued Giraffe; &ldquo;and
that this sort of machine is the only kind that it&rsquo;s
safe to own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so far as that goes he&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; admitted
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he couldn&rsquo;t get twenty-five dollars for
the tub if he put it up at auction!&rdquo; Bumpus asserted,
just as though he were an authority on all such
subjects; &ldquo;and here he asks a plump hundred for the
bunch of scrap iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the same Bumpus kept an eager eye fastened
on Thad, as though he were in hopes the patrol
leader might yet find some way to negotiate a deal;
for Bumpus would a thousand times rather travel
in the slowest and most uncertain car ever known
than to walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Offer him two hundred marks cash down,&rdquo; said
Thad; &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s a heap more than it&rsquo;s worth. The
balance is for the accommodation. We&rsquo;ll likely
throw it away after we&rsquo;ve used it a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, just as you say, Thad,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe,
and turning to the German owner of the car
he started in once more to dicker.</p>
<p>He had hardly gotten part-way through his speech
before the others saw a broad smile appear on the
red face of the man, who began to nod his head
eagerly. At the same time he thrust out his hand
toward Thad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye think of that, boys!&rdquo; exclaimed
Giraffe, apparently both surprised and disgusted;
&ldquo;he snapped me up like a flash. Two hundred
marks it is, Thad, and the trap is ours for keeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! why didn&rsquo;t we set it at a hundred,&rdquo; groaned
Bumpus; &ldquo;a fine lot of traders we are, I think.
No David Harums in this bunch. We&rsquo;re easy
marks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, two hundred of them,&rdquo; chuckled Allan.</p>
<p>Thad meanwhile, fearful lest the man might
change his mind, counted out some bills and handed
them over to Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write out a receipt in German, Giraffe, and
have him sign the same before you give him the
money,&rdquo; he told the go-between.</p>
<p>This Giraffe soon did, and the man signed it
without hesitation. Then clutching the money, he
said something to Giraffe, nodded his head several
times to the rest of the boys, and hurried away.</p>
<p>Somehow his actions, coupled with the way he
glanced back over his shoulder several times caused
the four scouts to look at each other in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think he means to do, now he&rsquo;s
got the money?&rdquo; Bumpus asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! put for home and hide it away in a stocking,
most likely,&rdquo; Allan laughingly remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He acted as if he was afraid we&rsquo;d repent, and
want the money back,&rdquo; suggested the patrol leader.
&ldquo;That price was about twice as much as the rattle-trap
is worth, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s hurrying off to get into
town and report that there are suspicious characters
on the road who talk English, and may be
spies from across the Channel?&rdquo; ventured Giraffe,
uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than that, it may be,&rdquo; said Bumpus mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain what you mean, then,&rdquo; demanded Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe he <i>stole</i> the car somewhere,&rdquo; suggested
the other, &ldquo;and before we know it we&rsquo;ll be hauled
up for the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought was far from pleasant. In the
present disturbed state of the Rhine country any
one who did not have the stamp of the Fatherland
on his face and in his tongue was apt to fare harshly
if placed under a cloud by any circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the sooner we get busy and fix up our
new purchase the better, I should say, no matter
where the man got it,&rdquo; Allan went on to remark.</p>
<p>Thad thought the idea so good that, taking off his
coat, he started in to working at the engine. He had
enough experience to know what was wrong, and
how to go about fixing the defect, with Allan at
his back to give occasional bits of advice which
helped out considerably.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Bumpus and Giraffe hovered around. They could
not be of any material assistance, and did not want
to get in the way so as to delay things. So they
talked matters over, and every now and then would
step closer to see how the workers might be getting
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope she holds out till we&rsquo;re safe over
the border, don&rsquo;t you, Giraffe?&rdquo; remarked the fat
boy, fanning himself with his hat, for the August
day was pretty warm, and there did not happen to
be a breath of wind blowing at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the tall scout, &ldquo;because once we
get beyond where the fighting is we can move
around without being held under suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Thad seems to be fixing things up, and
I do believe he&rsquo;s going to try the engine to see if
it works!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpus.</p>
<p>It took several efforts to get the result Thad was
after, but all at once the loud thumping told that he
had succeeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Bumpus, showing signs of excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; exclaimed Thad.</p>
<p>Fortunately the car happened to be headed in the
direction they wished to go, so there was no necessity
for turning, which might not have been an easy
task. All of them soon stowed themselves away
in the body of the car, though it required some
crowding, due principally to the fact that one of
their number took up enough space for two ordinary
fellows. Of course that was not the fault of poor
Bumpus, who was willing to squeeze himself into
as small a cavity as he possibly could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>When Thad started the car they actually found
themselves moving along at what seemed to be a
fair rate of speed, after their recent slow progress
afoot.</p>
<p>Bumpus almost held his breath for a short time.
He acted as though he feared he must be dreaming,
and that he would presently awaken to a bitter
disappointment.</p>
<p>After they had actually covered a full mile, and
the machine was still moving ahead, Bumpus could
restrain his exultation no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! this is the life!&rdquo; he exclaimed with a broad
smile on his happy face. &ldquo;A fellow would be a
fool to walk when he could sit here in his own private
car and whirl along the highway at this dizzy
pace of five miles an hour. Thad, that was a dandy
idea of yours about buying the wreck; and Giraffe,
I want to give you great credit for doing the bargaining.
Here we are headed for Belgium in fine
shape, and with our cares yet to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being boys, and with abounding spirits, they did
not believe in crossing bridges before they came
to them. So while unaware of what the uncertain
future might hold for them they did not mean to
worry. It was enough, as Bumpus said, that the
present looked sunny, with not a cloud on the horizon.</p>
<p>In that jolly frame of mind they started to do the
next mile with slightly increased speed, as the engine
&ldquo;got its second wind,&rdquo; as Giraffe called it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">THE BLOCKED WAY TO THE BORDER.</span></h2>
<p>They passed over a second and even a third mile
without having any trouble. Now and then they
overtook or met people on the road but although
the natives stared at seeing four boys in khaki riding
in that dilapidated old car they did not offer to
molest them.</p>
<p>Thad knew, however, that they had a rocky road
to travel, for many times they must run up against
soldiers, who would not be apt to let things pass
so easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming to a bridge ahead there, that spans
the river,&rdquo; he told the other three presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder will it be guarded,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard so much about the wonderful way every
little thing has been mapped out in case of war
being declared by Germany, that I reckon each
man, young and old, knows just what his part is
to be, and has rushed off to do it the first thing
when the news came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Thad, &ldquo;we were told that the older
men of the Landstrum would stay at home and
guard bridges, water plants, Zeppelin sheds, gun
factories and all such places. And unless my eyes
deceive me I caught the glint of the sun on steel
at that bridge right now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s a fact, Thad; I see soldiers, and
they&rsquo;re watching us come on,&rdquo; Allan observed, with
a tinge of disappointment in his voice.</p>
<p>It was with more or less anxiety then that the
scouts approached the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it would be wise to risk rushing
it!&rdquo; said Bumpus, and the idea of such a thing was
so ridiculous that Giraffe laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just imagine us bearing down on the guard in
this wheezy old trap!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;why, old
Don Quixote on Rosenante wouldn&rsquo;t be a circumstance
to us. He fought windmills, and we&rsquo;d have
to tackle German soldiers armed with guns. Well,
our only chance would be to <i>scare</i> them nearly to
death, so they&rsquo;d be unable to shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not think of taking any such risk,&rdquo; said
Thad, severely, though of course he knew very well
Giraffe was only joking.</p>
<p>With many a groan the car was brought to a
stand at the bridge. Three middle-aged men in
uniform stepped up, and one who seemed to be a
non-commissioned officer addressed them in German.</p>
<p>Of course it devolved on Giraffe to do the honors,
and so he proceeded to tell just who they were,
how they came to be on the Rhine, and how necessary
it was that they get back to Antwerp so as to
take the sick lady away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>All this had been arranged between Giraffe and
Thad beforehand; and possibly the former had
practiced his speech at a previous time, so that
there might be no hitch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bumpus was waiting and listening,
hoping for the best. The gruff old German soldier
looked at their passports, and then at the little
American flag which each one of them had fastened
to the lapel of his khaki coat.</p>
<p>He shook his head, and it was in the negative,
Bumpus noticed, with a spasm in the region of his
heart.</p>
<p>Then followed some more conversation between
Giraffe and the soldier; after which the former
turned to his comrades with a look of pain on his
long face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says we&rsquo;ve got to turn and go back to
Cologne again, boys,&rdquo; Giraffe informed them. &ldquo;He
has his orders to not let a single person cross the
bridge who doesn&rsquo;t live around here, and is known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are Americans, and he might have some
consideration for us,&rdquo; complained Allan, though he
knew just as well as anything, from the severe
look of the soldier, that talking would be useless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes no difference,&rdquo; Giraffe said, &ldquo;orders
are orders with him. I really believe if the Kaiser
himself should come along he&rsquo;d have to go back
again. He says we might as well give over our
foolish scheme of getting across the border into
Belgium, now that war has been declared, and the
fighting is going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Bumpus looked heart-broken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to give up this beautiful car,
and just when we were getting so used to it, too,&rdquo;
he fretted, as though that were the worst and most
cruel blow of all.</p>
<p>Thad knew it was folly to think of trying to
swerve that old man, who had an iron jaw, and
may have been with the army many years ago
when Paris was taken and France humbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must make out we&rsquo;re going to do what
he suggests, anyway,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone to the
others.</p>
<p>Then he began to maneuvre so as to make the
turn. It required some dexterity, for the old car
did not respond to the wheel very readily. In the
end, however, the turn was negotiated successfully,
without any accident. Bumpus had been clutching
the side nearest him as though fearful lest they
might be precipitated down the embankment into
the river.</p>
<p>It was with despondent faces that the boys started
back along the road which they had so recently
traveled in such high spirits. Bumpus, however,
believed that things were not utterly hopeless. He
had caught the words spoken by Thad, and to his
mind they could have but one meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we give up the ship at the first storm,
Thad?&rdquo; he asked plaintively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have to make a show of doing what they
ordered, you know,&rdquo; explained the pilot at the
wheel; &ldquo;but I noticed on that little map I bought in
Mainz that there&rsquo;s another good road leading to that
Belgian border. We can try that and see what
luck we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that it about a mile back, leading off to the
right as we came along?&rdquo; asked Allan, quickly,
showing that he, too, had kept his eyes about him,
as every wide-awake scout should at all times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Thad told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you mean to take it, do you, Thad?&rdquo; demanded
Bumpus, oh! so eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can make the try, and see what happens,&rdquo;
he was told. &ldquo;Of course, if every bridge and culvert
on the road has its guard, we&rsquo;ll not be apt to
get very far before we&rsquo;re hauled up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s all hope that if that happens it&rsquo;ll be
a man without that iron jaw, and one who might
listen to reason,&rdquo; Giraffe ventured, for he was feeling
badly over the utter failure of his attempted
negotiations with the guard.</p>
<p>They rode on in silence for a short time, and
then Allan cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your road ahead, Thad; and we&rsquo;ve lost
sight of the bridge long ago, so they couldn&rsquo;t see
us dodging into the same. There are some people
coming along, but they&rsquo;ll not notice what we&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you haven&rsquo;t changed your mind, Thad?&rdquo;
remarked Bumpus, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, Bumpus,&rdquo; he was informed, and
that satisfied the stout chum, for he sank back again
into his place with a grunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>It turned out that the second road was almost
as good as the other, a fact that caused the boys to
congratulate themselves more than once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certain sure do know how to make roads
over here in the Rhine country,&rdquo; Giraffe declared;
&ldquo;fact is, they do about everything in a thorough way
that makes a Yankee sit up and take notice. No
slip-shod business will answer with these Germans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they even turn you back when your passport
is O. K., and you&rsquo;ve got rights they ought to
respect; they&rsquo;re thorough all right, but it&rsquo;s too much
red tape to suit me,&rdquo; Bumpus complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No kicking yet awhile, Bumpus,&rdquo; Giraffe warned
him; &ldquo;you notice that we&rsquo;re still on the move, and
headed for the upper corner of Belgium&rsquo;s border.
If we&rsquo;ve got any decent sort of luck at all we ought
to make the riffle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re coming to some sort of town,&rdquo;
Thad told them, &ldquo;and as there&rsquo;s no way of turning
out here we&rsquo;ll have to take our chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did see a side road back a piece,&rdquo; remarked
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and running to the northwest in the bargain,&rdquo;
added Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would mean if it kept on straight it would
finally bring up at the Holland border, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
Bumpus wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose we&rsquo;re twenty miles away from
Holland right now,&rdquo; said Allan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we had to come to it, would you try to get
across the line there, Thad?&rdquo; asked the stout boy,
and when he was told that &ldquo;half a loaf would be
a lot better than no bread,&rdquo; he seemed to be satisfied
that all was not lost.</p>
<p>As they proceeded the evidences of a town ahead
of them became more and more evident. Neat
houses, each with its well kept garden, could be seen
on both sides of the road. Women and children,
many of them wearing wooden shoes, stared at
the car as it wheezed past, bearing the four boys.</p>
<p>Doubtless the sight of their khaki uniforms
caused a general belief that they must in some way
be attached to the army, for several boys ventured
to give them a salute, which the pilgrims hastened
to return in every instance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the kids over here have got the military
spirit born in &rsquo;em,&rdquo; remarked Bumpus, after a very
small specimen had waved his hand in real soldierly
fashion.</p>
<p>They were now entering the town, though it could
hardly be called by so pretentious a name, since
there was really but the one main street running
through it, with others cutting across.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; they heard Thad say; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re
going to be held up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several soldiers stepped out in the road. One
seemed to be an officer, from his uniform, though
he did not carry a sword. He held up his hand
in the manner of an autocrat who must be obeyed,
and of course Thad stopped the car just before
coming to the little squad. The other three soldiers
carried guns, and with such an array of weapons
it would certainly have been the height of folly for
the boys to think of running the gantlet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>To the surprise of Thad, the officer spoke in
excellent English. Perhaps he had at some time
been stationed in England, or else in the United
States, though that did not necessarily follow, as
undoubtedly many Germans were proficient in other
languages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must turn back!&rdquo; he said, severely; &ldquo;I do
not know that I would be exceeding my authority
if I ordered your detention under arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are American tourists, as our passports
will show you, sir,&rdquo; Thad explained; &ldquo;and all we
want to do is to leave the country. One of my comrades
here has an invalid mother in Antwerp and
he is wild to get to her, so he can take her back
home to America. Surely you will not want to keep
us here against our will, where we would be a
burden on you, and with four more mouths to fill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is sad,&rdquo; said the officer, with a shrug of his
shoulders, &ldquo;but now that war has been declared,
and we do not know what will befall the Fatherland,
we must do many things that would never happen
in times of peace. So while I am sorry for the boy
with the sick mother, it must not interfere with my
orders, which were that no one should be allowed to
pass on toward the Belgian border unless he showed
proof that he was in the service of the Central Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to hear you say that, sir,&rdquo; Thad told
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is still more,&rdquo; continued the other, sternly;
&ldquo;this is the second warning you have had to turn
back. We received word by telephone from the
bridge to look out for four American boys in scout
uniforms. Be careful how you risk a third offence,
for I fear it would result in your being thrown
into prison. And remember, it is a long way from
the country of the Rhine to your Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What he said gave the four chums a cold feeling.
They knew he meant that no matter how innocent
of any intention to do wrong they might claim to
be, if they persisted in breaking the rules laid down
by the German Government for war times, why
they must take the consequences, which could not
be very pleasant.</p>
<p>All of those castles in the air which Bumpus had
been conjuring up during their short ride now came
tumbling in ruins to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have to give it up, fellows,&rdquo; he
groaned, &ldquo;and take our medicine the best way we
can. We&rsquo;ve tried our hardest to get out of this
beastly country; and no one can blame us for not
succeeding. But I hate to think of my poor sick
mother over there, waiting and waiting for me to
come to help her, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">AT THE FERRY.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;If at first you don&rsquo;t succeed, try, try again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe was one of those fellows with a disposition
very much like a rubber ball; when crushed
down by some sudden disappointment he would
come up again on the rebound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s that other road!&rdquo; remarked Thad; &ldquo;and
do you see any one following after us, to watch,
and find out what we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, coast clear back here,&rdquo; said Bumpus,
nearly bursting a blood vessel in his endeavor to
look.</p>
<p>Thereupon the pilot deliberately disobeyed the
orders of the officer stationed in the town. He
turned into the side road, and thus gave positive
evidence of an intention to once more try to run
the blockade. At the same time Thad understood
what risks he was taking; only there may arise
situations that demand radical cures, unless one
means to lay down meekly and submit to Fate.</p>
<p>Bumpus began to show signs of renewed interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a case of two strikes, and then a
swat over the fence for a home run, Thad!&rdquo; he
announced, after they had gotten well started along
the new trail, which did not seem to be built along
the same order as those other roads, though not at
all bad in that dry season of the year, early August.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so,&rdquo; replied the pilot. &ldquo;From the
way this road runs we&rsquo;ll have to give up all notion
of getting across the line into Belgium. We&rsquo;ll be
lucky if we can make it Holland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, along here where a tongue of Holland
runs down between Germany and Belgium,&rdquo; explained
Allan, who had looked up these things on
the map, &ldquo;and which is a part of the Limberg country,
it isn&rsquo;t over twelve or fourteen miles across.
There&rsquo;s one place at the Holland town of Sittard
where the gap can&rsquo;t be much more than four miles,
so you see how easy it would be for us to run across
that neck, and land in Belgium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this lightning car,&rdquo; observed Giraffe, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d
hit the border, give one grand splurge, and then
bring up on Belgian soil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Limberg, you said, didn&rsquo;t you, Allan?&rdquo; remarked
Bumpus; &ldquo;I guess I know now where that
strong cheese comes from. I only hope we don&rsquo;t
strike any factories on the way. It always makes
me feel faint, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; snorted Giraffe, the taint of German
blood coming to the surface, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s because some
people don&rsquo;t know a good thing when they strike it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Giraffe, you ought to be glad then that I
don&rsquo;t, because sometimes you complain of my appetite,
as if I could help being always hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, of course we&rsquo;re bound to strike that
river again, if we keep on heading into the northwest?&rdquo;
suggested Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for it runs into Holland on its way to the
sea far above where we hope to cross,&rdquo; admitted
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a very important road,
for we haven&rsquo;t come across a single soul on it so
far,&rdquo; Allan suggested, significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And from the marks of wheels I&rsquo;d be inclined
to believe few vehicles ever come this way,&rdquo; continued
the patrol leader; &ldquo;but what makes you say
that, Allan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I was only wondering if it really kept on to
the river, or turned back after a bit,&rdquo; the other
explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is, you hardly think such a road would
deserve a bridge, which must be a pretty costly
proposition, the way they build them over here,
to last for centuries; is that it, Allan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ve struck it to a fraction, Thad. Now,
supposing there should only be a ford for a crossing,
we couldn&rsquo;t take this car over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; came the ready reply; &ldquo;but the
fact that so many cars travel the roads of Germany
in these modern days makes me feel pretty sure
there will be some kind of way for getting over the
river, even without a bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean by a ferry?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely,&rdquo; he was told, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re going
to know right away, for I had a little glimpse of
the river through those trees back there. We
ought to be there in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A &ldquo;jiffy&rdquo; might mean almost anything, but with
that slow car it stood for more than five minutes.
Then Allan heard Giraffe, who had abnormal vision,
give an ejaculation that had a smack of satisfaction
about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ferry, I guess, Thad!&rdquo; said the tall scout,
who had that neck of his stretched to an enormous
extent that gave him a great advantage over his
comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you say so?&rdquo; asked Bumpus, who
could see absolutely nothing as yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I notice a rope stretched across the river,&ldquo;
Giraffe told him, &ldquo;and yes, there&rsquo;s some sort of a
barge or float up at the landing on this side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allan just then announced that he, too, could see
what Giraffe was trying to describe, and there could
be no doubt about its being a ferry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck!&rdquo; cried Bumpus, puffing out with
new expectations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope they haven&rsquo;t gone and stuck a soldier
alongside the ferryman so as to keep him straight!&rdquo;
grunted Giraffe; &ldquo;and, Thad, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have
to do the interpreter act again, if the chap doesn&rsquo;t
talk United States?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We depend on you for that, Giraffe,&rdquo; he was
told.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>The road led directly down to the edge of the
water. There was some sort of landing there at
which the ferryboat put up. It allowed the traveler
who had a vehicle of any sort to pass directly from
the shore on to the deck of the monitor which was
used for a ferryboat.</p>
<p>No one was in sight when they first arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t show up couldn&rsquo;t we take charge
of the boat and run her across to the other side?&rdquo;
Bumpus was asking, as though about ready to try
anything once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toot your horn, Thad, and see if it&rsquo;ll wake him
up,&rdquo; Allan suggested. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so little to do on
his lay that p&rsquo;raps the ferryman takes a nap between
trips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; assented Thad, and accordingly
he used the auto horn to some advantage,
making certain doleful sounds that were easily calculated
to awaken any sound sleeper.</p>
<p>Immediately a man appeared in view. He may
have been taking a nap for all they ever knew. He
was an old fellow wearing wooden shoes and a knit
cap. As he approached the car he seemed to look
them over curiously. Probably it was seldom indeed
that any one outside of the natives came his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See him take in our little American flags, will
you?&rdquo; remarked Bumpus, while Giraffe entered into
a labored conversation with the ferryman; &ldquo;he must
know what they stand for, too, because I could see
his eyes light up when he first noticed the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe at that moment turned to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right about that, Bumpus,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;this man says he has a son and his family out in
Cincinnati, and wants to know if we&rsquo;ve ever met
Hans Kreitzner. I told him I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure,
because there were some people in America I&rsquo;d never
yet run across, though I hoped to round them all
up later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t josh the poor old fellow, Giraffe,&rdquo; urged
Bumpus; &ldquo;as for me, I&rsquo;m so glad because we haven&rsquo;t
run across a pesky military guard here at the ferry
I&rsquo;d be willing almost to promise to look his son up
when I got back home&mdash;by mail, of course, and tell
him I&rsquo;d met his respected paw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about taking us on his ferryboat, Giraffe?&rdquo;
asked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he hasn&rsquo;t got his strict orders, like all
the rest of the men we&rsquo;ve run across to-day,&rdquo; ventured
Allan.</p>
<p>Giraffe nodded his head in a way that stood for
hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to be all right, fellows,&rdquo; he assured them.
&ldquo;Old Hans here has agreed to set us over on the
other side. Perhaps when I promised to double his
fee it made him jump after the silver hook more
nimbly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there he goes now to get his ropes unfastened,&rdquo;
said Bumpus. &ldquo;Whew! from the way he&rsquo;s
tied the old batteau up I should think he hadn&rsquo;t
had a passenger all this day. He&rsquo;s as slow as molasses
in winter, and that can&rsquo;t be beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe looked at the speaker and grinned. When
Bumpus called anything &ldquo;slow&rdquo; it must move about
as tediously as an ice wagon, or one of those enormous
German guns drawn over the hard roads by
a powerful traction engine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me crawl out first, Thad,&rdquo; the fat boy remarked,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;re meaning to move the car aboard
the ferryboat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpus is afraid of you, Thad!&rdquo; cried Giraffe;
&ldquo;he thinks you may make a slip and dump the whole
business over the side of the boat; and Bumpus
doesn&rsquo;t care to go in swimming with his suit on.
If it should shrink when he tried to dry it, whatever
would he do for another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the same, Giraffe himself was not averse to
leaving the little old car while Thad was taking it
carefully aboard the flatboat used as a ferry, showing
that he might be just as guilty as Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now!&rdquo; exclaimed the fat scout on noticing
that even Allan joined them, &ldquo;seems like we
might all be in the same boat, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We expect to be, right away,&rdquo; Giraffe told him,
calmly.</p>
<p>Thad did not let the car play any trick. He soon
had it aboard the ferry, and about as well balanced
as any one could have accomplished. The
old man had just about finished undoing the last
rope, and in another minute they might expect to
find themselves moving out toward the opposite
shore, by means of the pulley fastened to the rope
above, and the long stout pole which was intended
for pushing in the shallow water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, there&rsquo;s somebody coming on a gallop up
there!&rdquo; announced Giraffe just then; &ldquo;and I do believe
it&rsquo;s a mounted soldier in the bargain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! thunder!&rdquo; gurgled Bumpus, almost collapsing;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s always the way things go. We get
just so far, and then the string pulls us back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let on that you see him,&rdquo; said Thad,
quickly. &ldquo;The old man is pretty deaf I should say
from the way you shouted at him, Giraffe. He
doesn&rsquo;t hear the man calling. Now, if he is so
busy pushing off that he fails to look up, we ought
to be half way out in the stream before that horse
gets down to the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming with a rush, I tell you!&rdquo; said Giraffe,
who had better opportunities for seeing than
any of the others, so that it did appear as though
at times it paid to have a neck that would stretch.</p>
<p>The ferryman had now thrown off the last rope
and was stooping down to take hold of the setting
pole. Another minute or so would decide the question.</p>
<p>Bumpus was so worked up that he could not keep
still. As usual, he advanced some wild idea, for
while not as a rule fertile in expedients there were
times when it seemed as though that slow brain
of the stout boy worked furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, hang the luck, fellows, the ferryman
has seen him!&rdquo; burst out Bumpus, in the deepest
disgust; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s going to wait up for the soldier, and
take him aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our cake will be dough,&rdquo; added Giraffe, gloomily,
&ldquo;if it happens that the man on horseback comes
from the town where we got turned back, and orders
us to go back with him, to be shut up in a
German dungeon. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about what terrible
nasty places those fortress prisons are, but I
never thought I&rsquo;d be in danger of finding out for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we have to give in so tamely as all that?&rdquo;
asked Bumpus, with a spurt of spirit that would
have become a warrior; &ldquo;suppose now he does try
to browbeat us, ought four husky scouts from good
old America get down and kiss the shoes of just
one bullying German soldier, because he wears a
helmet on his head. Thad, it&rsquo;s up to you to say
the word, and we&rsquo;ll all jump on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so rash, Bumpus!&rdquo; Giraffe warned him,
while Thad said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait and see what happens before we lay
plans that must make every man of the Kaiser&rsquo;s
army our enemy. Here he comes now. Every one
keep a still tongue in his head but Giraffe; and
while about it let&rsquo;s hide these little flags. If he
asks who we are tell him the truth, though, remember,
Giraffe!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">SCOUT TACTICS.</span></h2>
<p>The horseman was now coming down the bank.
Already he seemed to eye the four passengers aboard
the ferryboat, as though they interested him more
or less.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Giraffe,&rdquo; muttered Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the other, in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might take occasion to ask the ferryman
while we&rsquo;re crossing, whether we can strike the road
leading north to Grevenbroich, after getting over.
Get that name, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;ll do it as a sort of blind,&rdquo; continued
the other; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll naturally believe we&rsquo;re meaning
to put up there instead of heading across country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was undoubtedly a soldier, but Thad
came to the conclusion that he must now be on some
important mission rather than simply riding to a
concentration camp. In fact, he soon decided in his
own mind the other might be a dispatch-bearer, for
he noticed what seemed to be a small leather pouch
partly hidden under his long coat.</p>
<p>They were soon moving across the stream. The
man had dismounted before leading his horse aboard
the craft, since the animal showed positive signs of
not liking the ill-smelling old car. None of the
scouts blamed the intelligent animal either, for the
mingled odor of gasoline and burnt grease was
anything but pleasant; although they believed that
&ldquo;beggars should never be choosers,&rdquo; and that it was
bad luck to &ldquo;look a gift horse in the mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe did not forget his instructions. When
they were about half-way across he spoke to the old
ferryman, and apparently asked for directions about
the way to the town mentioned by Thad, for he
plainly said &ldquo;Grevenbroich.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>The man with the setting pole answered him,
and even pointed several times in a northwesterly
direction, as though assuring him that the place
mentioned lay in that quarter.</p>
<p>As though regretting one thing he had done, Thad
took out the miniature Stars and Stripes and fastened
the little flag to his coat again. He realized
that the man would readily guess they were not
Germans, and it was better that he know their nationality
than to suspect them of being English.</p>
<p>He looked sharply at the emblem, and his heavy
eyebrows went up, but he did not say a single word
to indicate what he may have thought.</p>
<p>The boys were only too well satisfied that matters
should be as they were. They had feared something
much worse, and that the soldier would order
them to turn back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say about Grevenbroich, Giraffe?&rdquo;
Thad asked, so that the horseman could plainly
hear him mention that name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it lies off there some ways,&rdquo; said the other,
also pointing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can it be reached from this road?&rdquo; further
inquired the scout leader.</p>
<p>Giraffe shrugged his shoulders. It was a new
habit he had picked up since coming abroad, for
over there on the Continent nearly every one depends
on contortions of the facial muscles, and
movements with the hands and shoulders to add
emphasis to what they say, or else take the place of
words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t understand all he said, you know,
Thad,&rdquo; he explained, with a broad grin, &ldquo;because
he speaks such terrible German, not at all like our
teachers gave us at school. But as near as I could
make out, this road comes to a place inside of a mile
or so where it branches in three different directions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said Bumpus, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t dream
it was of so much importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One road runs southwest to the city of Duren,
where the railroad from Cologne goes, and where
all the soldiers are pouring through on the way to
Belgium. Then another runs almost north, and
lands you at Grevenbroich; while the third keeps
on until it strikes the border at the Holland town of
Sittard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gravenbroich is the place for us!&rdquo; said Thad,
meaning to ring the changes on that particular name
until it had become impressed on the mind of the
listening soldier who must naturally believe they
were headed thither.</p>
<p>They believed they had deceived him when the
landing was made, for after paying the ferryman he
sprang on his horse and galloped away, never once
looking back over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Thad willingly handed the man the sum agreed
on, and the old fellow was very polite, making sure
that everything was secure before allowing them to
get the car off the float.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was what I call luck,&rdquo; said Giraffe, as they
lost sight of the river and the queer ferry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Soon we ought to come to the three forks of
the road,&rdquo; announced Allan; &ldquo;when we must decide
whether we want to go to Duren, Grevenbroich or
the Dutch border.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if there could be any doubt which we&rsquo;d
choose,&rdquo; observed Bumpus.</p>
<p>A short time later and they found themselves
drawing near the split in the road. Just why there
should be so many feeders for so ordinary a road
none of them could understand; they simply found
it so, and acted accordingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we strike out over the middle one,
Thad?&rdquo; Giraffe remarked; &ldquo;but I say, what&rsquo;s going
to happen, now that you&rsquo;ve pulled up here at the
forks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for me a minute, while I take a look and
see which way our friend with the horse went,&rdquo; the
other told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad never forgets he&rsquo;s a Boy Scout, and able
to find things out in a way that would never occur
to any ordinary fellow,&rdquo; said Allan, not without
a touch of genuine admiration in his tone; for he
realized, much to his regret, that there were times
when the same could not be said of him, skillful
tracker that he was, as all Maine boys are supposed
to be.</p>
<p>The three of them sat there in the car and
watched Thad. Apparently he had not the slightest
trouble in finding what he was looking for, since
the hoofs of the horse had left plain imprints on
the dusty road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s turned up the road that leads to Duren, all
right, as sure as anything!&rdquo; announced Giraffe, after
they had seen Thad pass along that way for a
short distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means a good riddance of bad rubbish,&rdquo;
laughingly remarked Allan.</p>
<p>When a minute later Thad returned he looked
satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He started on that way, and so far as I tracked
him he kept right along, so it looks as if we might
be well rid of him,&rdquo; he reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess all that talk about Grevenbroich told on
him,&rdquo; insinuated Bumpus, proudly, as though the
idea had originated with him, and he felt that the
credit should come his way also.</p>
<p>They had just started off and gone about a hundred
yards when Giraffe was heard to snort in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Played a neat game on us after all!&rdquo; he exclaimed;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re a fine lot of babes in the woods to
let a German soldier bamboozle us in that way.
Look over yonder and you can just manage to
glimpse him through little openings in the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s galloping off in the direction of Duren!&rdquo;
cried Bumpus; &ldquo;and I warrant you after
going along that road a piece he came back on the
side, to hide, and was there watching us all the
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad shook his head as though he did not like
the situation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;if he had any suspicion
before about us, it must have doubled when he saw
me following his tracks, and then watched us come
along this road. He knows now all that talk about
Grevenbroich was hot air, and that we&rsquo;re making
for the Dutch border.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and going lickety-split at that!&rdquo; added
Giraffe, contemptuously, as the engine emitted several
sounds as closely approaching groans of protest
as any inanimate object could produce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s to be done about it?&rdquo; asked Bumpus,
uneasily, looking behind him, as though half
anticipating seeing a squad of Uhlans with their
bedecked lances chasing headlong after the suspicious
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Thad. &ldquo;All we can do is to
keep pushing on, trusting both to luck and our sagacity
to pull us through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one comfort about it, boys,&rdquo; Allan told
them; &ldquo;every rod we cover means we&rsquo;re just that
much nearer safety. If we can only get within a
mile or so of the border, and the cranky old motor
holds out we&rsquo;ll give them all the laugh, even if it
means a hot chase at the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the old tub would be equal to showing
a clean pair of heels if you hit up the pace for
all it was worth,&rdquo; questioned Giraffe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be
afraid we&rsquo;d all go up in a cloud of smoke and fire.
These sort of machines are always balking or else
exploding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! now you&rsquo;re just saying that to bother me,
Giraffe,&rdquo; complained Bumpus; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got too
much confidence in our pilot to be afraid of trouble.
It may stop on us, that&rsquo;d be the worst that
could happen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you notice we&rsquo;re coming to a place where
it&rsquo;s well settled, for you can see fields on every side,
and gardens, too. Yonder are some women and
boys getting in the harvest; and here comes an old
man, his cart loaded down with some kind of roots
or potatoes. I hope there isn&rsquo;t a town ahead of us,
where we&rsquo;d find that the officer had telephoned about
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Giraffe who said this. When making out
to be tormenting Bumpus he was evidently only
voicing his own fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the road chart shows no place worth mentioning
along this section,&rdquo; Thad assured them;
&ldquo;but you know the soil here is something like that
in Holland, and very rich. Westphalia and Rhenish
Prussia are the garden spots of Germany, so we&rsquo;ll
see plenty of farms and grain fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, as they passed along they saw people
working in the fields on every side, but it was always
the same, not a single stalwart young man, only
boys, women and very old men. The rest had all
obeyed the call to the colors, and were already either
fighting at the front, or else in concentration camps,
preparing for the time when they would be needed
to fill awful gaps in the ranks.</p>
<p>All at once the engine stopped short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call a low-down trick!&rdquo; said Giraffe,
as Thad sprang out to throw back the hood
so as to take a look, and see what was wrong this
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we must expect something like that to happen
every little while,&rdquo; he was told by Allan; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
a poor arrangement at the best, and pretty well
worn out in the bargain. But we agreed to make
the best of it, and so what&rsquo;s the use of knocking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three of them sat there for a little while, as
Thad pottered at the refractory machinery. Then
Allan jumped out to assist him, saying that &ldquo;two
heads might be better than one,&rdquo; as often proved
to be the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake me up when you&rsquo;ve found out the trouble,
and rectified the same,&rdquo; said Giraffe, pretending to
stretch himself out over the seat, and make ready
for a nap.</p>
<p>Just about three minutes later he had reason to
change his mind. It was Bumpus who did it, and if
Giraffe suddenly started up it was not because the
other had been malicious enough to thrust a pin into
his leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, looky here what&rsquo;s bearing down on us,
Thad, will you?&rdquo; the fat scout had called out, and
Giraffe was up on his feet like a flash.</p>
<p>As he turned and looked back he saw something
that was not apt to make him feel happy, to say the
least. Along the road came a swarm of women,
boys and old men. They must have been recruited
from the fields near by, for they were carrying
all manner of pitchforks and such tools that looked
dangerous when held in the hands of aroused tillers
of the soil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Whether the people of the farming country could
have received word concerning the four boys in the
old car, and meant to effect their arrest; or mistook
them for some other parties who may have been
disturbing the peace in that section of the country,
Thad and his chums were fated never to learn.</p>
<p>It was quite enough for them to know just then
a threatening cloud had appeared above the horizon,
and that unless they could fortunately get a quick
start out of that particular neighborhood they stood
a good chance of finding themselves warmly beset.</p>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">DODGING TROUBLE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; burst out Giraffe, of course using
his favorite expression to denote his great astonishment;
&ldquo;why, they must be running to interview us,
fellows! And say, I don&rsquo;t just like the way they&rsquo;re
hollering one single bit. They even act as if they
might be real mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same old story,&rdquo; mumbled Bumpus, sinking back
into his seat with a look of sudden misery on his
round face; &ldquo;out of the frying pan into the fire.
Hardly off with one trouble before we&rsquo;re taking on
a new one! What&rsquo;s the end going to be, I&rsquo;d like to
know?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, how&rsquo;s it coming on?&rdquo; asked practical Allan,
as he once more leaned over the hard-working
mechanic, ready to lend a helping hand if possible,
though only one could properly work at a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m getting it straight now,&rdquo; came the
quick response that gave Giraffe fresh cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;ll be too late in another five minutes,&rdquo; declared
Bumpus, trying to figure just how long it
might take that oncoming crowd of German country
people to arrive on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less than that, Bumpus,&rdquo; said Giraffe, better
used to judging distances; &ldquo;three would be the
limit. Are we intending to haul off and try to
defend ourselves, or do we just throw up our hands
and tell &rsquo;em we surrender? They&rsquo;re mostly women
and old men, which accounts for &rsquo;em not getting
over ground faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but such women!&rdquo; echoed Bumpus; &ldquo;every
one looks like a regular Amazon, because they&rsquo;re
so used to working in the fields. Besides, I don&rsquo;t
like the way they handle those pitchforks they&rsquo;ve
been using to handle the hay with. It makes goose-flesh
come up all over just to think of having the
tines of a pitchfork stuck into me. Guess we&rsquo;d
better call it off, and be good if they surround us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may all be a mistake, after all,&rdquo; said Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see how that could turn out,&rdquo; grumbled
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These honest people may be taking us for some
other boys who have been pestering the life out of
them,&rdquo; Allan hastened to explain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hope they find out the truth then before they
start to prodding us with those old forks!&rdquo; Bumpus
breathed.</p>
<p>Then silence fell upon them. Thad was working
furiously, while the other three held their breath
in suspense, mingled faintly with the hope that
died hard.</p>
<p>The oncoming crowd was now quite close. Their
appearance became even more awe-inspiring as they
drew nearer the scene; and their loud, angry cries
did not soothe the nerves of the anxious scouts.</p>
<p>Bumpus was even fumbling in one of his pockets
with the idea of taking out a supposed-to-be white
handkerchief, and waving it, to indicate that they
did not mean to resist the coming onslaught.</p>
<p>Just then Thad gave a cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! have you got it, Thad?&rdquo; gasped Bumpus.</p>
<p>For answer the patrol leader slammed down the
engine hood, and seizing hold of the crank gave it
a whirl. There was no response! Bumpus groaned
fearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is lost!&rdquo; he exclaimed in abject despair.</p>
<p>Thad made a second try, but with the same disappointing
result. This time Giraffe sank back in
his seat, a look of resignation on his angular face.
Two bad turns was apparently his limit.</p>
<p>It proved fortunate that Thad was not constituted
that way. He had known engines to require as
many as half a dozen trials before they consented
to be good and turn over. So Thad went at it again,
with even more energy than before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>What a thrill passed over them all when with
a roar the engine started in to make the old car
quiver from end to end. Bumpus and Giraffe could
not restrain their pent-up enthusiasm; their recent
scare only added to the vim with which they gave a
shout.</p>
<p>Thad made a leap into the front seat of the car.
Allan had already settled down to do the honors
temporarily, for every second counted with that
mob not thirty feet away. If the car was stalled
five seconds longer it would be all up with the
scouts.</p>
<p>Nothing so bad as that happened, for away they
went with a jump, amidst the angry cries of the
disappointed crowd. The country people did not
mean to give up without further effort, for most of
them continued to run. They must have seen that
the car was an old and ramshackle one, and cherished
hopes that they might yet overtake it.</p>
<p>Giraffe stood up and waved his campaign hat excitedly
as he cheered in the good old American
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for the machine!&rdquo; was the burden of his
cry; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s actually doing her little five miles an
hour, perhaps even more. Say, this is getting too
reckless for my blood. I forgot to take out any
life insurance, Thad, before starting on this break-neck
trip. Be careful, please, and don&rsquo;t spill us
out!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Soon they saw the last of their pursuers, and the
road seemed to be clear in front. The boys of
course began to chatter concerning this latest happening,
trying to figure out what had caused this
sudden and mysterious feeling of enmity on the
part of the workers in the harvest fields. In the
end, however, they had to give it up as an unsolved
puzzle; nor did they ever learn the facts, since they
came to that part of the German Fatherland no
more.</p>
<p>Allan consulted the little road chart which, before
they started down the Rhine on their wonderful
cruise, had been purchased in Mentz, principally
to know the nature of the many sights that were to
be met with along the historic banks of that famous
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As near as I can make out, this is where we are
right now, Thad,&rdquo; he mentioned, making a pencil
mark on the paper. &ldquo;I know it from many reasons,
and one of them is that fine old Dutch windmill we
just passed on the knoll. It&rsquo;s marked here, you
can see, as if it had some historic connections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about that part of it, Allan,&rdquo; said
the scout leader after taking a quick glance at the
chart, for his attention was needed at the wheel,
since the progress of the car was inclined to be
erratic; in fact, as Giraffe had several times declared,
&ldquo;she did not mind her helm very well, which
made their course a zigzag one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how much further do we have to go before
we get to the Dutch line?&rdquo; Bumpus asked, with
more or less concern; for every two minutes he
had kept twisting around, almost putting his neck
out of joint, with the idea of making sure that they
were not being pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m figuring what course we&rsquo;ll have to take in
order to avoid several German towns that are
marked here,&rdquo; returned Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, we have no use for even the cleanest
towns agoing just now,&rdquo; ventured Giraffe,
&ldquo;though I&rsquo;m getting pretty hungry, to tell you the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cruel of you, mentioning it,&rdquo; spluttered
Bumpus, &ldquo;when I&rsquo;ve been fighting all the while to
forget that I&rsquo;ve got an awful aching void inside of
me that&rsquo;s wanting to be filled the worst kind. But
how far do we have to go, Allan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than five miles more,&rdquo; came the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds encouraging, I must say,&rdquo; remarked
Thad; &ldquo;if the cranky old thing holds out another
half hour we might be on the border; and once
across, our troubles will be done with for awhile
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she must be making all of <i>ten</i> miles an
hour, Thad!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe, pretending to be
greatly excited; &ldquo;why, I can feel my hair beginning
to stand up with the nervous strain! It&rsquo;s the nearest
approach to flying I ever expected to meet up with.
If we have an accident when going like the wind
they&rsquo;ll have to collect us in baskets. I&rsquo;m going to
hold on to Bumpus here, let me tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded the fat scout, suspiciously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! nothing much, only sometimes it&rsquo;s a mighty
fine thing to have a good buffer when you meet up
with trouble,&rdquo; said Giraffe, calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind him, Bumpus,&rdquo; said Allan; &ldquo;nothing
is going to happen, for the motor seems to be on its
best behavior. Let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;ll find only a Dutch
guard on the road when we come to the border
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s apt to be the case,&rdquo; ventured Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; added Allan, &ldquo;because the Germans as
yet couldn&rsquo;t be expected to care who left their country
for Holland; while the Dutch would want to
make sure there was no infringement of neutrality,
no using their territory by one of the belligerents
for passing around and taking the enemy by surprise.
If either German, Belgians, French or
British soldiers happen to land on Dutch soil they&rsquo;ll
have to be interned there until the close of the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all I hope is that they won&rsquo;t include Boy
Scouts in that class,&rdquo; ventured Bumpus, whose sole
thought those days was to reach Antwerp and the
suffering mother, who must be very anxious for her
boy, knowing he was at the time in Germany and
doubtless caught in the mad whirl accompanying
the mobilization of millions of troops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might if we were German scouts,&rdquo; Thad
told them, &ldquo;but we can easily prove that we belong
on the other side of the Atlantic. I think they&rsquo;ll be
pretty kind to us on that account, and do anything
we might ask.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, with a longing look
in his eyes, &ldquo;if we happened on a nice clean tavern
over there it might pay us to stop and get a Dutch
dinner. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about what appetizing
dishes those housewives can serve, and I&rsquo;d like to
say I&rsquo;d eaten just <i>one</i> meal in the Netherlands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count on me to vote with you, Giraffe,&rdquo; observed
Bumpus, &ldquo;though of course if it was going to
delay us any I&rsquo;d be willing to stand the famine till
we got over in Belgium, and had to put up for the
night on account of darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that matter, we will have a moon about
nine o&rsquo;clock to-night,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid
you&rsquo;ll have to excuse me from driving this crazy
car over roads I don&rsquo;t know, by moonlight. It&rsquo;s
bad enough in broad day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They continued to push steadily on. At no time
were they out of sight of farms and gardens, all
of them as neat as anything the boys had ever seen.
They often remarked on the great difference between
the thrift of these German market gardens
and the ordinary shiftless way of doing things seen
in their own country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Allan said, in trying to excuse this
want of neatness, &ldquo;we have all sorts of people come
over to us, and they bring their habits along with
them. Some are as careful about keeping their
places clean as these Germans, while others never
knew a thing about thrift in the native lands, and
have to be taught. But on the whole we seem to get
along pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How goes the mad whirl now, Allan?&rdquo; asked
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than two miles away from the border,
my map says,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds good to me,&rdquo; Bumpus assured them,
rubbing his hands together much as a miser is supposed
to do when gloating over his gold; &ldquo;huh!
two little miles oughtn&rsquo;t to keep us long on the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when you&rsquo;re navigating the roads in such
a whiz-cart as this,&rdquo; chuckled Giraffe, as he started
to get partly out of his seat to look around him, so
as to discover anything new worth calling his companions&rsquo;
attention to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello&mdash;we didn&rsquo;t make all that dust back
there, did we?&rdquo; the others heard him saying, as he
shaded his hand to look, and then almost immediately
went on to exclaim: &ldquo;as sure as you live it&rsquo;s
a little squad of horsemen, and they&rsquo;re coming along
at a fast gallop! What&rsquo;s that they&rsquo;re holding so
that the sun glints from the ends like it does when
you use a glass in heliographing a message? Boys,
I do believe they must be lances!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lances!&rdquo; burst out Bumpus, in sudden alarm;
&ldquo;why, that would mean they are the German rough
riders they call the Uhlans; and Thad, if they&rsquo;re
coming after us they&rsquo;ll overhaul this old pony go-cart
as easy as falling off a log!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE COUNTRY OF WINDMILLS.</span></h2>
<p>Of course everybody became tremendously excited;
at least everybody but Thad, who somehow
seemed to be able to retain his coolness in the presence
of peril better than any of his comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are four of them!&rdquo; announced Giraffe,
immediately, &ldquo;and they&rsquo;re digging their spurs into
their nags for all that&rsquo;s out. I guess they know
we&rsquo;re meaning to cross over into little old Holland,
and they want to nab us before we can get over the
border line!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have been sent after us by that smart
officer we ran up against at that town; the one who
turned us back, and threatened to arrest us!&rdquo; Allan
remarked, this being the one explanation of the pursuit
that flashed into his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either that,&rdquo; added Bumpus, &ldquo;or else the chap
who was on the ferry with us told of the meeting
after he got to Duren, and they sent out that squad
with orders to bring us in, dead or alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad was saying not a word. He seemed to be
devoting all his attention to manipulating the old
car so as to get every atom of speed out of it possible.
Besides, since its course was so erratic he
had to be very careful how he steered, as even a
slight blunder might mean a smash-up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Thad had not even made the slightest attempt to
look back and see their oncoming pursuers. He was
content to take the word of his mates for it that
they were making great headway, and closing in on
them at a rapid rate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is getting mighty interesting, let me tell
you!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe, as he twisted his long
neck again and again in order to watch the rush
of the cavalrymen, and then try to judge whether
the car could gain an offing before being overhauled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see what looks like the border post ahead
there another mile!&rdquo; Allan now told them.</p>
<p>That was indeed cheery news, and must have
revived their drooping courage. Still naturally
Giraffe immediately expressed a desire to know
on what sort of foundation Allan fixed his assertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think it&rsquo;s the crossing where
we strike Holland?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I can see soldiers in uniforms, and they
don&rsquo;t happen to be the gray kind we&rsquo;ve seen most
Germans wear, either. Yes, and they&rsquo;ve got what
looks like high-peaked caps, which I&rsquo;ve read the
Dutch troops use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpus, and the others knew
he must be greatly worked up, for as a rule Bumpus
never used words like this, leaving that to Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are they doing now?&rdquo; asked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catching up hand over fist,&rdquo; replied Giraffe.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be an open question whether they
reach us before we cross the line, or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I think we&rsquo;ve got a good chance to slip
over, unless something happens to our cranky old
engine,&rdquo; Allan asserted, for it was his nature to
be sanguine, just as the tall scout could not help
looking at the gloomy side of things as a rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now they&rsquo;re lashing their mounts like everything,&rdquo;
reported Giraffe; &ldquo;and seems to me they do
get more speed out of the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus did not attempt to get up any more, so
as to look. He had a firm grip on the side of the
quivering car, and was staring ahead. Perhaps he
was trying to figure how happy he would be if
only they could rush across that border line, and secure
the protection of those Dutch soldiers.</p>
<p>They were drawing very close to the haven of
refuge, so that it was easy for all of them to see the
little squad of guardians stationed there to see that
the strictest neutrality was maintained. While the
Netherlands might seem to be a small country, still
she has an active army of some five hundred thousand
soldiers, and history tells how bravely the
Dutch have always fought when their country was
invaded.</p>
<p>Germany would not want to have such a foe on
her flank. Besides, many of those harbors of Holland
would be extremely valuable to an Allied navy
seeking to strike at the heart of the gun foundry
region of the Fatherland.</p>
<p>Giraffe was becoming more excited than ever.
He fairly quivered as he reported the lessening of
the distance between the fleeing car and the pursuing
horsemen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Faster! Thad, give her all the juice you can!
<a href="#front" id="rfront">Squeeze a little more speed out of the poor old thing</a>,
and we&rsquo;ll do it yet!&rdquo; was the burden of his
appeal.</p>
<p>Of course Thad was trying everything he could
to coax the motor to do just a little mite better.
Small things count at a time like this, and even the
wobbling motion that the car continued to keep up
as it ran was counting against them, more or less.</p>
<p>But the race could not last long now. The Dutch
border guard had spread out, and seemed to be
ready to do some threatening with their guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope they don&rsquo;t mean to shoot at us,&rdquo;
Giraffe was heard to say when he noticed this; &ldquo;if
only we had a big enough flag for them to see
they&rsquo;d know we were Americans, and friends. I
wonder how it would do for me to shout out that
word as we come up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would do no harm, Giraffe!&rdquo; Allan told him.</p>
<p>Accordingly the tall scout began to make frantic
gestures as he stood there, trying to balance himself
in the swaying car. He had an idea that he was
using his arms to denote their peaceful intentions;
but possibly the puzzled Dutch soldiers might imagine
him stark crazy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Americans! We&rsquo;re American boys!&rdquo; he kept
shouting.</p>
<p>Bumpus tried to pull him down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re shooting at us back there, Giraffe!&rdquo; he
pleaded, &ldquo;and you might get hit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>It seemed that the Uhlans were using their weapons,
though when going at that wild pace they
could not have had much hope of doing any execution,
unless by some accident.</p>
<p>A dozen seconds more of suspense followed, every
one of which must have seemed an eternity to
the fleeing scouts. Then they reached the line of
the Dutch border guard and were thrilled to know
they had actually left German soil behind them.</p>
<p>Thad immediately shut off power, and applied
the brake, for he had seen that one of the guard
made a motion easily interpreted. Giraffe was dancing
about in the car, though Bumpus after having
his toes trodden on several times promptly shoved
him out.</p>
<p>The Uhlans had given up the pursuit. They
evidently felt so chagrined over having failed to
overhaul the fugitives that they would not even
wait to exchange words with the Dutch soldiers, but
wheeling their horses started back along the dusty
road.</p>
<p>Of course the Dutch guard at once gathered
around. Giraffe wondered whether his poor command
of German would serve him in this case as
well as it had done under other conditions. He
was saved from this anxiety, however, for the one
who seemed to be in command of the post immediately
addressed them in fair English. He must
have taken his cue from the way Giraffe shouted
that word &ldquo;American&rdquo;; and then, now that they
had come up, it was easy to see those miniature flags
pinned on the lapels of the scouts&rsquo; khaki coats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>He proceeded to ask questions, and Thad was
only too well pleased to answer. The passports
were shown, and seemed to satisfy the soldiers.
There would be hundreds, yes thousands of non-combatants
presently seeking an asylum on the
neutral soil of Holland; and those warm-hearted,
hospitable people would show the world that they
had no superiors when it came to holding out a
helping hand to those in distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have Boy Scouts over here in Holland,&rdquo; the
non-commissioned officer proudly told them; &ldquo;and
they have won the respect of the whole Nation.
Only here in Europe, you know, every boy has to
look forward to serving the colors at some time in
his life, so they all expect to be soldiers of the
Queen later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will not think it necessary to detain
us, sergeant?&rdquo; Thad asked, after he felt sure they
had made a good impression on the Dutch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please stretch a point if you can,&rdquo; pleaded Bumpus,
&ldquo;for I am wild to get over in Belgium where
my poor sick mother is waiting for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldier scratched his head as though a little
puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would know what to do if you were enlisted
men of any country at war,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;it would
then be our duty to interne you until peace came.
But orders have not been so clear about what to
do if citizens of the United States choose to cross
our country. I might hold you until you could
communicate with your Minister, Dr. Van Dyke; or
on the other hand I might just wash my hands of
you, and let you go as you pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s most kind of you, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bumpus, possibly meaning to help the soldier choose
the latter course; &ldquo;all we want to do is to cross over
this neck of Holland and enter Belgium, so we can
go around the fighting line without getting caught
in the mess. Thad, we&rsquo;ll never forget this kindness,
will we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was really clever in Bumpus to exert this species
of flattery in order to gain his end. Perhaps
it did influence the Dutch sergeant more or less, for
he smiled amiably and offered his hand to Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get across as quickly as you can,&rdquo; he told them;
&ldquo;for my superior officer will be due here presently,
and he might look at things in a different light from
what I do. I spent several happy years in your
country once, and then came back home to marry,
and serve out my time in the army. Good luck to
you, young mynherr, and to all of you. That is all;
you can go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lost no time in making a fresh start. The
superior officer might happen to come along ahead
of time, and spoil all their plans.</p>
<p>It was with considerable satisfaction Bumpus
looked around him at the new sights that met their
eyes as they passed across that narrow strip of
territory belonging to Holland, and which stretches
down between the other two countries as if it were
used as a convenient buffer, and for no other purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a real Dutch windmill, yes, and I can
see some more of the same kind!&rdquo; Bumpus was telling
them, pointing excitedly as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they&rsquo;re as common as dirt, you&rsquo;ll find,&rdquo;
Allan told him. &ldquo;They not only pump water but
are used for a great many other purposes. A
Dutchman would almost as soon think of doing
without his vrouw as his windmill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given half an hour, and if this road isn&rsquo;t too
wobbly we ought to be at the Belgian frontier,&rdquo;
Thad announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve carried everything by storm so far,&rdquo; said
Giraffe, exultantly; &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s some hope we may
get to Antwerp. If the Germans over the line
couldn&rsquo;t hold us in check we oughtn&rsquo;t to be much
afraid that the Belgians will try to detain us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder now if that can be an inn we see
ahead there?&rdquo; suggested Bumpus, with a most intense
longing look on his face as he shaded his eyes
with one hand the better to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like some sort of a road-house,&rdquo; Thad
ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Giraffe, almost as eagerly as the
fat scout, &ldquo;and I can see what must be a swinging
sign hanging there. Thad, hadn&rsquo;t we better take
a chance, and say we&rsquo;ve tasted one meal in Holland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you, Allan?&rdquo; asked the patrol
leader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could tackle any sort of stuff just
about now. We had an early breakfast on the boat,
you know, and it&rsquo;s now getting along in the afternoon.
I&rsquo;m willing to try most anything once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that settles the question,&rdquo; he told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we stop over, do we?&rdquo; demanded Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three against one would carry the day, because
scouts believe in majority ruling,&rdquo; said Thad; &ldquo;and
to tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m pretty savage myself for
something to eat. So we&rsquo;ll pull up, and see what
they can give us at this hour.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">AT A WAYSIDE BELGIAN INN.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It looks all right to me, fellows!&rdquo; remarked
Bumpus, as they approached the inn where a swinging
sign announced that travelers and their animals
could be entertained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if the grub is as attractive as the surroundings,&rdquo;
added Giraffe, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d wish it was night
time right now, so we could put up here. I&rsquo;ve
heard how neat as wax these Dutch vrouws are
about their beds and food, and it&rsquo;d sure suit me
to try the thing out. But of course, since Bumpus
here is in such a hurry to get to Antwerp, we
couldn&rsquo;t think of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t blame me, I feel sure, Giraffe?&rdquo; mentioned
Bumpus, with a vein of mild reproach in his
mellow voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure not,&rdquo; instantly replied the tall scout, for
he felt that those blue eyes of his chum were filled
with surprise; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do everything I can to help
get you there in a rush, even to going hungry if
I have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we haven&rsquo;t come to the starvation point
yet, I hope,&rdquo; the red-haired chum told him, as the
car stopped in front of the road-house, and all of
them clambered out.</p>
<p>Giraffe patted the seat as he left it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, you&rsquo;ve turned out to be a heap better
than you look, old stick-in-the-mud car,&rdquo; he said,
meaning it as a compliment; &ldquo;appearances are often
deceptive, and in the pinch you didn&rsquo;t fail us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be thankful for that,&rdquo; said Thad.
&ldquo;I know my heart seemed to be up in my throat
more than a few times when we were making that
last mile of the mad race. I thought sure the
engine would give up the ghost with a groan, and
leave us there stranded on the road to be taken
prisoners by those Uhlans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we&rsquo;re the lucky bunch, take it from me,&rdquo;
said Giraffe; &ldquo;but here comes mine host, smiling
all over at the honor we do his house to stop our
elegant car before the door. I&rsquo;ll try him in my
best Teutonic first; but I hope he can understand
United States Dutch like our friend back at the
border post.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>The landlord joined them. He wore a long
white apron, and had a clean look that impressed
all of the boys immensely. His face was as rosy
red as health and good living could make it.</p>
<p>It turned out that, while his English was faulty,
he could understand the language fairly well, and
that was the main thing.</p>
<p>When the boys explained to him that they were
hungry, and hoped he could get them up some
sort of a dinner, he readily promised to do the
best he could, though of course, he explained, it
was long after the usual hour for dining.</p>
<p>So they found a way to wash up, and then sat
on the broad porch resting while awaiting the call
to dinner. Their car attracted more or less attention;
but Giraffe was of the opinion this was
because of its dilapidated appearance more than
anything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to be seen driving such a wreck over
around Cranford,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;but here it was
a case of take it or leave it, and there you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just you go slow about running that machine
down,&rdquo; warned Bumpus, shaking his head threateningly;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s served us a noble purpose, let me
tell you. Think of all the tiresome tramping we&rsquo;d
have been forced to do only for our great luck
in picking up this vehicle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Allan, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll never know, I suppose,
where that man got it, or whether we bought a
stolen car; but it stood the racket splendidly, and
we won the day against the crack horses of the
German cavalry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Just then the urbane landlord came to announce
that dinner was served, and there was a hasty
exodus from that porch. The boys had sharp appetites,
and everything tasted just right, for there
is no better sauce to any meal than hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is only a picked-up dinner,&rdquo; said Bumpus,
as he sighed and shook his head when Thad
asked him to have a fourth helping, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
sit down to one of the regular ones, just to see
what it would be like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All through?&rdquo; asked Thad. &ldquo;If you are, I&rsquo;ll
settle the bill, after which we&rsquo;ll cut for the western
border line. We ought to get over a few Belgian
miles before night comes on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even the thought of finding themselves on Belgian
soil thrilled the scouts. It was easy to understand
why this should be so. There the two
armies were fast in a death grapple, with the Germans
doing the assaulting, and the heroic forces
of King Albert trying to delay the passage of the
invading hosts across their land as much as was
possible. The mere idea of being close to a battlefield
was enough to fill their boyish hearts with
eager anticipations, for without experience along
these lines they could not as yet realize the horrors
of war.</p>
<p>The settlement proved to be an easy one. This
Dutch landlord at least had not learned the tricks
of his trade, so far as overcharging travelers
was concerned, for his prices were exceedingly
moderate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>When once more they found themselves on the
road, and headed into the west, the boys began to
discount their arrival at the other border line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll run smack up against more
Dutch soldiers on guard there,&rdquo; said Allan; &ldquo;because
by now they&rsquo;ll be mobilizing all their forces,
so as to be ready if they have to enter the war
to preserve their country. You&rsquo;ve often heard of
Dutch courage, and they do say these smiling soldiers
don&rsquo;t know what fear is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope that this road across into Belgium
isn&rsquo;t guarded as yet,&rdquo; ventured Giraffe, &ldquo;or else
that they&rsquo;ll be glad to get rid of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not a great while later that they discovered
a white post alongside the road. There
had been one just like it back where they came over
from the country of the Rhine, and from this they
judged they had arrived at the dividing line.</p>
<p>Several soldiers now appeared, attracted by the
noise made by the exhaust of the car, for the
muffler worked poorly even when used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re giving us the high sign to pull up,
Thad,&rdquo; announced Giraffe, as the Dutch guards
were seen to make motions.</p>
<p>Some difficulty was experienced on this occasion,
for none of the Dutchmen could speak any English.
Giraffe worked hard to explain just who
they were, and how they simply wanted to be allowed
to cross over into Belgium on a peaceful
errand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Bumpus hung on his words, and looked so appealingly
at the puzzled guards that it could be
easily seen he hoped there would not be any miserable
delay.</p>
<p>By dint of extravagant gestures, displaying the
little flags on their coats, saying the word &ldquo;American&rdquo;
lots of times, then &ldquo;Antwerp,&rdquo; and finally
pointing toward the southwest, in the end Giraffe
seemingly managed to convince them that all the
boys in the old car wished was to be let alone,
and continue their journey.</p>
<p>Finally one of the guards nodded his head,
shrugged his shoulders, spoke to his companions,
and after about ten minutes&rsquo; delay they stepped
aside, as if to signify that the way was clear, and
they would not interpose any further objection to
the boys going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Giraffe, as he settled back in
his seat, &ldquo;get her moving, Thad, before they wake
up and change their minds! I kind of think I
mesmerized that big chap some. He looks half
dazed still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you must have talked such a mixture of
German and American that he began to think we
were all crazy,&rdquo; laughed Allan; &ldquo;but no matter,
we&rsquo;re thankful for even small favors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Bumpus, who was vastly relieved
by this sudden change for the better in their fortunes,
&ldquo;as for me, I&rsquo;d be willing to be looked on
as demented if only it carried the day for my
plans. We&rsquo;re across the line, Thad, wouldn&rsquo;t you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt about that, Bumpus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And this is really Belgium we&rsquo;re running
over?&rdquo; continued the delighted stout scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, really and truly,&rdquo; Giraffe told him; &ldquo;but
it looks as like Holland as two peas in a pod. If
it wasn&rsquo;t for the Dutch guard, and the white border
post, none of us would ever know we&rsquo;d changed
countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that they continued to forge ahead at a
fair pace as the balance of the afternoon slipped
away. Once the engine chose to balk, which necessitated
an overhauling on the part of Thad and
Allan. Happily the trouble was again located
and rectified, so that they did not lose a great deal
of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing sure, Thad,&rdquo; said Giraffe,
who had been prowling around while the repair
work was going on, looking into a number of
things; &ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t think of going much more
than another hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gas tank getting low, is it?&rdquo; asked the other,
who had seen Giraffe meddling in that quarter,
and could make a good guess as to what discoveries
he had run upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it is,&rdquo; replied Giraffe; &ldquo;about enough
juice to do us till we want to stop for the night.
We must manage to buy ten gallons or so in the
morning, no matter what they ask for their old
petrol, as they call it over here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, you see how obliging a car we&rsquo;ve happened
on,&rdquo; said Bumpus. &ldquo;It holds out till we get
ready to stop over, and then asks for a fresh supply.
I think this must be a French make of car,
it&rsquo;s so very polite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just so,&rdquo; said Giraffe; &ldquo;do you know, I&rsquo;ve
been suspecting for some time it was swearing in
French every time it groaned and grunted when
Thad was driving the engine so hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next hour passed and once again fortune
seemed to favor the boys, for just as the sun was
about to sink out of sight they came to a village
where they discovered a quaint-looking inn.</p>
<p>When they found that there was plenty of room,
and that they could be supplied with a supper and
a breakfast, the boys asked for nothing better.
The car was taken into a sort of barn, where cattle
were munching their feed, and left there.</p>
<p>As before Thad and his chums managed to find
the pump, and washed up the best way possible,
after which they sat around in the taproom, waiting
for the welcome call to the table.</p>
<p>There were a number of men over by the bar,
where they talked in their own language, which
of course the boys could not understand. But
Giraffe seemed to think one of the natives took an
unusual amount of interest in the new arrivals,
since he looked their way again and again, and
called the attention of another fellow to the wearers
of the khaki uniforms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Of course, it might be that the possession of
these same garments had aroused the curiosity of
the man; but Giraffe fancied he had a sinister look
on his face, and being possessed of a suspicious nature,
the boy actually got up and sauntered over
to the door, after he saw the party go out.</p>
<p>Looking that way, presently Thad discovered
that Giraffe had actually vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope now he doesn&rsquo;t get himself in any
scrape,&rdquo; Thad told the others, for he knew only
too well the impetuous nature of the boy with the
long neck.</p>
<p>Allan and Bumpus did not think there was any
reason for fearing such a thing. According to
their way of looking at it, everything seemed peaceful,
and Giraffe was acting foolish in entertaining
any suspicions.</p>
<p>About five minutes later, with supper as yet not
placed on the table, Giraffe entered the room about
as silently as he had left it a while before. He
hurried over to where his three chums were lounging,
and they began to rouse themselves at noticing
an expression of excitement on the other&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong now?&rdquo; asked Thad, just as
though Giraffe could always be looked on as the
bearer of bad news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; came the answer; &ldquo;that fellow
with the sneaky eyes is a bad egg, and he means
to do us trick or I miss my guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you only saying that in a general way, or
do you know something?&rdquo; asked the scout leader,
in the voice he used when giving orders to the
troop in place of Dr. Philander Hobbs, the real
scout master, who was often absent when the boys
were enjoying an outing in camp or on the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I followed him outside,&rdquo; continued Giraffe,
sinking his voice to a mysterious whisper, &ldquo;and
saw him talking with some other tough-looking fellows;
and, let me tell you, they acted mighty
suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">THE THROB IN THE NIGHT BREEZE.</span></h2>
<p>Thad may have thought that, up to this point,
Giraffe was allowing his suspicions to overcome his
better judgment; but he now saw the other was
unusually serious. So the scout leader considered
it wise to ask a few questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many others did he talk to, Giraffe?&rdquo; was
what he first wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were two, all told,&rdquo; came the answer;
&ldquo;I think one was that fellow with the coarse laugh,
and the other may have been the man almost as
broad as he was long, and who made our Bumpus
here look like a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted the party referred to, &ldquo;I always
told you I wasn&rsquo;t such great shakes when it
came to topping the scales; but you&rsquo;ve got us interested,
Giraffe, so give us the whole story while
you&rsquo;re about it, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they only get their heads together and
talk?&rdquo; Thad continued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that was just the beginning,&rdquo; admitted
Giraffe; &ldquo;and if it stopped there, how would I
know that they were bothering themselves about
a party of boys who had dropped in to spend the
night? It was what they did that gave them
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us about it, then,&rdquo; said Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when I saw them making for the barn,
I kind of suspected they meant to look over our
car, and I slipped along after &rsquo;em. Course my
having been a scout helped me a lot to do that
without giving myself away,&rdquo; and there was a
vein of justifiable pride in the way the tall boy
said this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it our car they looked over?&rdquo; asked Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were nosing all around it,&rdquo; replied Giraffe,
&ldquo;when I glimpsed them through a knot-hole.
Would you believe it, that man with the crooked
eye was lighting matches to let them see better.
And they certainly did overhaul the car from stem
to stern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, it might be they thought we left something
valuable in the car, such as a pair of expensive
field-glasses, you know?&rdquo; suggested Bumpus,
as though seized with a bright thought for
once.</p>
<p>The others waited to hear what the spy thought
of that idea. Giraffe, however, did not seem to
consider it an answer to the riddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said decisively; &ldquo;they acted as if they
were more concerned about the car itself, for they
even tested to see whether there was any amount
of petrol in the tank, and looked the engine over
in the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they want to make us an offer for the
car in the morning?&rdquo; Bumpus once more advanced;
&ldquo;but I hope none of you&rsquo;ll feel tempted to part
with it, while we&rsquo;re still so far away from
Antwerp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t look as if they had pockets full of
money,&rdquo; Giraffe told him scornfully. &ldquo;My idea
was that they mean to steal the car some time during
the night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad sat, and seemed to be turning it over in
his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean for their own use, Giraffe?&rdquo; he
asked finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, if you ask me plainly, Thad, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the
other admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; muttered the fat scout, who
would not stay squelched; &ldquo;why do people go
around taking cars if not for themselves, I&rsquo;d like
to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe lowered his voice still more, and in consequence
Bumpus felt an additional thrill pass
through him, it was all so mysterious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For their Government they might,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;How do we know but what these Belgians are
so patriotic they think it only right strangers should
be made to contribute to the good of their army?
They must have great need of every kind of motor
conveyance just now, to bring up their troops.
The German army has tens of thousands of big
motor-trucks, we heard. Well, they looked over
our old car with the idea of running her off if it
seemed worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, do you take any stock in that idea?&rdquo;
asked Allan, as though somewhat in doubt himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be possible,&rdquo; was the reply of the patrol
leader. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing I do know, and that
is, no matter what they want our car for, they
mustn&rsquo;t be allowed to take it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; said Bumpus joyfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we all feel sorry for poor little Belgium,
dragged into this terrible war when she hadn&rsquo;t done
a single thing to bring it on, still we&rsquo;ll need that
car ourselves for some time yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Bumpus, &ldquo;and, Thad, for one I&rsquo;m
willing to turn the machine over to the Belgians,
such as it is, if they can make any sort of use of
it, just as soon as we strike Antwerp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; added Giraffe; &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t quite
told you all yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, is there another chapter to the story?&rdquo;
asked Bumpus, getting ready for a second edition
of those thrills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I watched them come away from the barn,&rdquo;
continued Giraffe; &ldquo;though of course they didn&rsquo;t
know anybody was around. They walked along
the road a bit, and I saw them stop to speak to
another man. And, Thad, he was a soldier!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a fact?&rdquo; remarked the other, deeply interested
of course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He wore the uniform of an officer, I want you
to understand!&rdquo; Giraffe added; &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the
main reason why I think they mean to steal the
car for the use of the Government. Perhaps they
haven&rsquo;t just got to the point here of taking anything
they see in sight, like the Germans are doing,
we were told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the call to supper,&rdquo; said Bumpus, struggling
to his feet with considerable difficulty.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the last word about this business, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this,&rdquo; he was told, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to try and
protect that car to-night, if we have to camp out
there in the hay and guard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second the motion!&rdquo; said Giraffe, with all the
vim he was capable of showing, for he dearly loved
excitement and action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t say another word about it while
we&rsquo;re eating,&rdquo; warned Thad. &ldquo;There may be people
at the table or nearby who could understand
English. We&rsquo;ll talk of other things we&rsquo;ve met
with in the past. There are heaps of incidents that
might be worth while bringing up again, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say there were,&rdquo; admitted Giraffe;
&ldquo;fellows who have hit the trail down in the Blue
Ridge Mountains of North Carolina; tramped and
camped up in the pine woods of Maine; had a summer
cruise through the Lake Superior region; spent
a time down in the swamps of the Sunny South;
and even hunted big game away out among the
Rocky Mountains, shouldn&rsquo;t find it hard to rake
up things to talk about, it strikes me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>The meal passed off pleasantly enough. There
was plenty to eat, and all cooked in a way that
satisfied their boyish tastes. At the table were several
other people, but as they conversed in Flemish
and the boys did not understand much of what
was said, they made no attempt to enter into the
general talk.</p>
<p>After eating all they wanted, they left the table
and sought the outside of the inn. It was quite
dark by now. At Giraffe&rsquo;s suggestion they sauntered
over to what he called the &ldquo;barn&rdquo; to make
sure the car was all right.</p>
<p>Thad happened to have a small pocket electric
flash-light with him, which he found very valuable
at various times when a means for illuminating
was required. Making use of this he detached the
spark-plug, and thus rendered the car useless until
another could be obtained capable of filling the
gap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might keep them from stealing the car,&rdquo;
he observed, &ldquo;and again it wouldn&rsquo;t. Even if I
had a chain, and locked the wheels, they could file
it off, given a little time. So on the whole I think
we&rsquo;ll have to camp out here. The night&rsquo;s warm,
and it won&rsquo;t be the first time all of us have hit
the hay actually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;d have to let the landlord know,&rdquo; suggested
Allan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best to tell him privately, if you say
so,&rdquo; declared Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time find out what our bill is and
we&rsquo;ll pay in advance,&rdquo; said Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea in doing that?&rdquo; Bumpus wanted
to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to let him understand we haven&rsquo;t any intention
of slipping off, and beating him out of an
account,&rdquo; explained the other. &ldquo;And, Giraffe, another
thing you can do; that is, if you are able to
tackle it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said the other simply, just as a Missourian
might say, &ldquo;Show me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him to understand that we&rsquo;re armed, and
would defend our property to the last gasp,&rdquo; was
the astonishing declaration Thad made, though he
could be heard chuckling at the same time, as
though himself more or less amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re not, Thad, you know; we haven&rsquo;t
got more than pocket knives along with us this
trip. Even those we used aboard the boat we
packed up with the other junk, to be sent across
to America when we wrote to that boatyard man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Bumpus who made this protest; the others
understood that Thad must have some sort of little
scheme of his own which he intended to make
use of; so they only waited to hear its nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find some of the tools to handle,&rdquo; he told
them, &ldquo;and in the half dark even a monkey wrench,
if you know how, can be made to look like a revolver,
especially if you click! click! when aiming
the same!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; was the comment of Giraffe;
&ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve seen the game worked myself, and to tell
the truth had my knees knocking together as if I
had the ague till the chap who was giving me the
grand scare had to laugh outright, and broke the
game up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we might as well go back and sit on that
porch till we feel sleepy. Then Giraffe can tackle
the landlord and have it out with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad&rsquo;s suggestion appeared to strike them all
favorably, and it was not long afterward when they
settled down to making themselves as comfortable
as possible. There was more or less conversation,
though gaps came between, for the boys found
themselves rather tired. They had not slept as
well during the last night or two as they might,
owing to numerous things, worries of the mind
more than of the body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering what that queer far-off throbbing
sound can be?&rdquo; Giraffe happened to mention
all at once; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hearing it for some time, and
it comes as regular as a clock, once in so many
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been listening to the same,&rdquo; admitted
Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you can give us an idea what
causes it?&rdquo; asked Bumpus, after he too had caught
the odd sound, the like of which they could not remember
ever having heard before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s the discharge of a monster siege
gun!&rdquo; was Thad&rsquo;s startling declaration, which of
course provoked a series of outcries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean away over at Li&eacute;ge, where we&rsquo;ve
been told the Germans are trying to batter down
the conical-top steel forts by dropping monster
shells on them from points miles away?&rdquo; Allan
asked in a hushed voice, as though thrilled by the
thought.</p>
<p>Thad went on to say that he could not think of
any other reason for the strange sounds. He also
told them to notice that some of the men they had
seen inside the inn had come out, and seemed to
be listening to the sounds as if they had a sinister
meaning to them.</p>
<p>It was indeed a strange experience for the scouts.
They had been in contact with a great many remarkable
happenings in the past few years, especially
since the troop had been organized at Cranford;
but never had they expected to be sitting
and listening to the deep-throated throb of giant
guns engaged in a terrible battle of opposing
armies.</p>
<p>Although they tried to picture the stirring scene,
of course it was utterly beyond their capacity; for
no one who has not looked on a battle can imagine
what it is like.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Giraffe even had the nerve to express a wish that
some time or other he might be privileged to see
what a modern engagement was like; but of course
it was only a thoughtless boyish desire. Before
he was through with this journey over the war
trails of Belgium possibly he would regret having
ever made such a remark; for there might be some
things come into his experience that he would be
glad to forget.</p>
<p>Long they sat there in the warm night air, listening
to the sounds that came, now faintly, and
anon in a louder key, according to the character
of the breeze that wafted them to their ears.</p>
<p>Then Thad, seeing that Bumpus had allowed his
head to fall forward on his chest, told Giraffe he
had better seek the landlord and sound him on
the scheme of their sleeping in the hay-mow within
the barn.</p>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">WARNED OFF.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking it all over,&rdquo; said Giraffe,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got it arranged. You know our landlord
isn&rsquo;t much on the American lingo, and I expect to
have some little trouble making him understand;
but I&rsquo;m getting my hand in at this interpreter business,
and I&rsquo;ll make it or bust the boiler trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; cautioned the patrol leader, &ldquo;to
give him to understand that we love the fresh air,
and really prefer to sleep in the open, being scouts.
Yes, and you can hint at the same time that it
would be a serious thing for any rascals if they
tried to steal our car.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suspect the landlord knows anything
about the raid, if there is going to be one?&rdquo; asked
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Thad told him, &ldquo;but
there&rsquo;s no harm giving him that hint; he may manage
to push it along and save us some excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! that doesn&rsquo;t bother me any,&rdquo; remarked
the other disdainfully; &ldquo;you know I live on excitement.
But I&rsquo;ll try and do all you say, Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was gone some time, almost twenty minutes,
and when he once more appeared on the porch it
was with his arms full of blankets. Bumpus was
sound asleep in his chair and breathing as peacefully
as though safe at home in his own bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! but I&rsquo;m weak,&rdquo; said Giraffe, sinking down
in a seat, the blankets being dropped to the floor.
&ldquo;Oh! it isn&rsquo;t because of the heft of those coverings,
you know, but the way I had to work to
get that old innkeeper to understand. When he
did finally get it through his head he was as nice
as pie about it&mdash;insisted on getting four clean
blankets for us, and hoped we&rsquo;d have a pleasant
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that part is settled,&rdquo; remarked Hugh.
&ldquo;He took the money, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing, Thad. Did you ever hear of one
of his kind shoving any cold cash aside when it
was offered to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he act as if he felt disappointed at our
wanting to stand guard over our old car?&rdquo; asked
Allan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he tried to tell me that people were very
honest around this place, and never even fasten
their doors. Fact is, you can&rsquo;t find a lock in
the inn, only a hook to keep the doors from flying
open. But I must say I couldn&rsquo;t see any sign
of his being upset by our action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I reckon he doesn&rsquo;t know the plan of those
men, if they do really intend to try and run the
car off,&rdquo; Thad concluded.</p>
<p>Giraffe yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, I&rsquo;m as sleepy as they make &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
he remarked. &ldquo;Suppose we trek over to the barn
and get busy. Me for the hay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Bumpus here to be looked after,&rdquo; suggested
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks so happy it&rsquo;s a pity to wake him up,&rdquo;
said Thad; &ldquo;but of course we couldn&rsquo;t think of leaving
him here on the porch all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook Bumpus gently as he said this. The
fat boy gave a grunt, but beyond this there was
no sign of life about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Bumpus!&rdquo; said Thad, giving him a
little rougher treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! leave me alone, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; grumbled the
other; &ldquo;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t mornin&rsquo; yet. When the coffee&rsquo;s
ready I&rsquo;ll climb out, I tell you. Leave me be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus evidently imagined that he was in camp
somewhere, with some of his chums bent on routing
him out at an unearthly early hour. Thad
this time gave him so sturdy a shake that Bumpus
began to sit up and rub his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! what&rsquo;s all this, anyway? Where am I
at? I was dreaming that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he commenced,
when the impatient Giraffe interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what you were dreaming, Bumpus;
we&rsquo;re going out to the barn to sleep, and, unless
you want to be left alone here on the inn porch
the rest of the night, hump yourself and trot along
with us. I&rsquo;ve got a blanket here for you, see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course Bumpus stirred himself at that. He
quickly realized he was indeed far away from the
dearly beloved camp up on Silver Fox Island in
Omega Lake, near his home town of Cranford.</p>
<p>Once out at the so-called barn they began their
simple preparations for sleeping in the hay. The
moon had arisen and flooded the world with light
on that August night. Everything looked so peaceful
and lovely that Thad found it hard to believe
tens of thousands of human beings were engaged
in a terrible and sanguinary battle only a comparatively
few miles away from that spot.</p>
<p>Still, whenever he listened carefully, and the
night wind happened to be just right, it was easy
for him to hear that uneasy grumbling which he
knew must come from the fighting line, where the
Germans were battering the steel fortresses at
Li&eacute;ge day and night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>With the supply of petrol down to the last dregs,
and a section of the necessary working parts of
the engine secreted, it would seem as though thieves
might have some trouble in carrying the car off,
even if they came to the barn. But Thad did not
mean to take any chances.</p>
<p>When each of them had been apportioned his
bed in the hay, within touch of one another, Thad
gave a few last instructions.</p>
<p>It was understood that no one was to do anything
to betray their presence until Thad uttered
the signal. Even Bumpus had it sternly impressed
on his mind that if he felt a hand shaking him he
was to simply hold his breath and lie quiet, waiting
for the next move.</p>
<p>Thad&rsquo;s little electric torch came in very handy
in selecting their sleeping quarters, though he did
not use it more than was necessary.</p>
<p>Finally all settled down to get what sleep they
could. Bumpus had been forced to lie on his side
so that he might not make any of those queer snorting
sounds which so often amused his fellow-campers,
and frequently excited their ire in the
bargain.</p>
<p>Thad, being a light sleeper, expected to be
aroused should any one open the door. The sudden
influx of moonlight was calculated to accomplish
this, but he did not depend on that alone. Having
found a small, empty tin can, he fixed it so
there would be something doing in case the door
moved, enough noise made to arouse him, whereupon
he could touch each of the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Some time must have passed before Thad was
awakened by this same small clatter. He felt Allan
move on one side of him, showing that the second
leader of the Silver Fox Patrol was on the alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give Giraffe a shake, Allan!&rdquo; he whispered in
the other&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, for he kicked me just then!&rdquo; replied
the other, in the same cautious tone.</p>
<p>It only remained to arouse Bumpus. Thad would
have let the fat scout sleep right along, only he was
afraid his heavy breathing might awaken suspicion,
and lead to an investigation before they were ready
to spring their surprise.</p>
<p>For once Bumpus proved to be on his guard when
Thad bending over shook him, and at the same
time whispered in his ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Bumpus, and keep as still as a mouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lay there, hardly daring to breathe, for all
of them could tell that some one was opening the
wide doors of the barn, since the moonlight began
to flood the interior. It was quite thrilling for the
boys to be lying there straining their eyes so as
to see to advantage.</p>
<p>Dark figures flitted in through the opening. They
could hear low-muttered words, and might have
understood what the intruders were saying only
that none of the scouts happened to be up in the
Flemish language, which was like so much Greek
to them.</p>
<p>But from the fact that the prowlers immediately
gathered around the car and seemed to be once more
examining the same, it was easy to understand
their motives at any rate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Thad waited to make sure that their night visit
might not have been caused by some other motive
than a desire to steal the property of himself and
chums. When after considerable fussing around
he saw that the men were actually starting to push
the car outside, he knew it was folly to hold back
any longer.</p>
<p>So Thad gave the signal. The other three had
doubtless been waiting, like hounds held in the
leash, for the call to arms. Instantly Allan and
Giraffe sprang erect, while poor, clumsy Bumpus,
trying to be exceptionally swift, got his feet entangled
and actually rolled out into full view.</p>
<p>Thad instantly turned his torch upon the
astounded schemers. The intensity of that white
glow must have done much to demoralize them.
If anything more were needed, it was supplied when
the three figures extended their right hands and
seemed to be covering the intruders with what
looked like dangerous pistols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of this, you rascals, or we&rsquo;ll open fire,
and shoot you down like dogs!&rdquo; Thad shouted, and
the whole three of them waved their weapons in
a most suggestive manner that could not well be
mistaken.</p>
<p>It is of course doubtful whether those fellows
understood a single word of that dreadful threat.
They did know, however, that they were caught
nicely in the act of stealing other people&rsquo;s property,
and that safety could only be secured by a hasty
departure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>It was surprising the way in which they vanished
through the open doors. Even the big man
mentioned by Giraffe as being equal to three of
Bumpus seemed to slip away as if on wings of fear.
So the four scouts were left to shake hands with
each other over their great victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was almost too easy,&rdquo; said Giraffe, who
seemed disappointed because he had not been able
to get in a single blow.</p>
<p>Still Thad said they should be satisfied with having
chased the thieves off, and in this fashion saved
their property. He fastened the doors again, set
his tin-can trap, and told the others he was going
to finish his sleep out, as he did not fear any further
annoyance.</p>
<p>In fact, the balance of that night passed without
anything happening to arouse the four chums.
Morning found them ready for breakfast, and congratulating
each other on the success of their little
game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d be out a car, such as it is, this morning,&rdquo;
asserted Allan, &ldquo;if we hadn&rsquo;t camped out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose we&rsquo;ll ever know just what they
meant to do with her,&rdquo; suggested Bumpus; &ldquo;and
we don&rsquo;t care much, either. When a fellow&rsquo;s been
robbed it doesn&rsquo;t matter to him what becomes of
the stuff. But seems to me I smell cooking going
on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>That was enough to excite Bumpus, and Giraffe
as well. They were soon enjoying a hearty breakfast,
and as the landlord asked no questions they
did not think it worth while to tell him about the
night alarm.</p>
<p>The next problem was to secure a supply of
petrol. While there was no scarcity of the fluid
as yet, still every one who owned any seemed to
suspect that the time was near at hand when it
would become very valuable, especially if German
raiders overran this part of Belgium, and commandeered
every gallon they could discover.</p>
<p>Upon asking the landlord he put them on the
track, and in the end they were able to purchase
just five gallons, at about three times the usual price.
Still this would enable them to make a start, and
there was always hope that they could pick up a
further supply as they went along, even if it had
to be in driblets, a gallon here and another there,
to eke out.</p>
<p>Leaving the roadside inn, the boys were feeling
in fairly high spirits, especially Giraffe, who declared
that with such luck on their side they were
bound to get to Antwerp some way or other, sooner
or later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you we&rsquo;re just bound to do it,&rdquo; he said,
with spirit, as they moved along the road, &ldquo;and if
all other channels are blocked, what&rsquo;s to hinder
us backing up again and crossing the border into
Holland? We could make our way to Rotterdam,
and there take a small boat through the inside
passages to the Schelde River, so as to get to Antwerp
all right. So keep that in your mind, Bumpus&mdash;when
the Silver Fox boys settle on doing
a thing it has to come, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">THE PENALTY OF MEDDLING.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The thing that&rsquo;s bothering me,&rdquo; said Bumpus,
a little later on, &ldquo;is this. If the military in Belgium
here are so hard up for cars that they&rsquo;d even
think to take such a tough-looking machine as this,
how are we ever going to keep hold of the same,
somebody tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the best we know how,&rdquo; Thad informed
him. &ldquo;For one thing, every time we chance
to run across any Belgian soldiers I intend to coax
the engine to puff and groan the worst you ever
heard. It&rsquo;ll help discourage envy on their part.
We&rsquo;ll act as though it&rsquo;s stalled every twenty feet,
and that we&rsquo;re having a dickens of a time with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That idea amused Giraffe, who laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly does take you to get up some of
the smartest games going, Thad,&rdquo; he ventured; &ldquo;and
I guess now that&rsquo;d be the best dodge to save our
palatial car from being commandeered by the army.
When they see what a cantankerous mule it is,
they&rsquo;ll ask to be excused from trying to bother with
such a kicker.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Perhaps the car understood what they were discussing.
At any rate, it proved to be most accommodating,
and tried to give them as good an excuse
for calling it hard names as it could. At
the very next rise it refused to work its passage
and only for Thad&rsquo;s expertness in backing into a
gully they might have had a wild return ride down
the grade, with a fair chance for an upset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! look at that, will you?&rdquo; puffed Bumpus,
after half tumbling from the car, when the others
jumped nimbly out; &ldquo;now we <i>are</i> up against it good
and hard. If the poor old tramp refuses to make
the climb, however are we to get over the rise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off your coat, Bumpus,&rdquo; Thad told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! do we have to really <i>push</i>?&rdquo; asked the fat
scout, looking at the balance of the hill, and scratching
his head in a manner that told how little he
enjoyed the prospect ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way,&rdquo; Giraffe explained, &ldquo;unless
we want to leave the car here, and continue our
long journey afoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That caused Bumpus to get out of his coat
hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything but that!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;And when
you get me started at a thing I guess I can do my
share, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He proved as good as his word, because Bumpus
was strong, even if he seldom cared to exert
himself, on account of indolence. When four
husky, well-grown boys get busy, with their shoulders
against a vehicle that has balked on a rise,
they are able to accomplish a good deal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>There were several things in their favor. In the
first place, the car was far from being a very heavy
one; then the hill did not have a steep grade; and
they were half way up when the engine refused to
do its duty; besides, they could rest several times
by allowing the car to back into the gully again.</p>
<p>Bumpus did his full share of the work, though
with many a grunt. In the end they reached the
top and then got aboard, after Thad had made sure
the engine would do its duty again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for a good, long coast down-grade,&rdquo; said
Bumpus, as though that pleasure would pay up in
part for his recent labor; as he expressed it himself,
&ldquo;It helped take the bitter taste out of a fellow&rsquo;s
mouth, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you limping about the last part of
the way, Bumpus?&rdquo; asked Allan, as they continued
their journey, after reaching level ground again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I must have worked too hard,&rdquo; explained
the other, with a grin, &ldquo;because it seemed just like
I&rsquo;d strained my muscles some way. Feels some
sore at that, and it&rsquo;s lucky I don&rsquo;t have to do
any walking about now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, what would you call that thing away
off yonder? Sometimes it disappears in among the
fleecy clouds, and then comes out again. From here
it makes me think of one of those big buzzards we
used to watch soaring ever so high up, while we
were down in Louisiana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad gave a steady look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an aeroplane!&rdquo; he told them positively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Allan had apparently come to the same conclusion
himself, for he instantly echoed the assertion
of the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hawk about that, or buzzard either, if they
have such things over here in Belgium,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;See, there&rsquo;s another of the same kind further on.
They must be German Taube machines, and are
being used to spy on the positions of the Belgian
forces down below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them looked and wondered, as was quite
natural, for although they had of course seen aeroplanes
maneuver many times at county fairs and
other places, this was their first experience at watching
the evolutions of war machines doing scout
duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see how valuable they are going to be in
this war,&rdquo; Thad remarked. &ldquo;From a safe position
thousands of feet above, the aviator can see every
movement of troops, note the coming of reinforcements,
take stock of the position of every battery
of big guns, and by a code of signals inform his side
just how to direct their fire in order to do the
most execution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! it&rsquo;s wonderful when you come to think
of it,&rdquo; Giraffe exclaimed, with a whistle to indicate
the state of his feelings; &ldquo;and I can see how an
up-to-date war with such a country as Germany is
bound to give the world heaps of surprises and
thrills.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just stop and consider,&rdquo; said Allan, still gazing
at the far-away soaring objects among the light
clouds, &ldquo;what those chaps are seeing as they sail
around up there. It must be a wonderful spectacle,
and I&rsquo;d give a lot to be up there half an
hour or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it must be dangerous work at that, I&rsquo;d
think,&rdquo; observed Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All aeroplane work is,&rdquo; admitted Giraffe, &ldquo;and
if you once started to take a drop it&rsquo;d be the end.
You&rsquo;d never know what had happened; but, say,
I&rsquo;d pity the poor fellow underneath when <i>you</i>
landed, Bumpus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that, Giraffe,&rdquo; expostulated the
other; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you suppose now if those are German
airships the Belgians must be cracking away
at them with their guns and trying to bring them
down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be silly not to, Bumpus,&rdquo; replied Giraffe,
&ldquo;and if we only had a glass along the chances are
you&rsquo;d be able to see some of the bombs or shrapnel
exploding up there. But it&rsquo;s hard to hit such a
moving target, and besides I reckon the pilots fly
high enough to be well out of range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since leaving the roadside inn they had covered
quite a few miles, with nothing out of the way happening,
except that little trouble on the slope of the
hill. Thad had studied the little chart he carried
with him, and tried to lay out a route which he
hoped would carry them beyond the danger line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>He understood that the invaders must be stretching
out toward the west so as to control that section
of country. There was a chance that at any
time the boys might meet with a raiding band of
rough-riders connected with the German army; but
he hoped this would not happen, for it was likely
to spoil all their plans and set them back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this is getting too sleepy for anything,&rdquo;
Giraffe was complaining finally. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even
have any housewife rush out and threaten us for
running over her dog, or killing a poor old hen.
Why, even the ducks can waddle out of reach of
our slow-poke car. It makes me feel like I&rsquo;m going
to a funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the same old Giraffe,&rdquo; declared Bumpus,
chuckling, &ldquo;always finding fault. Now the only
thing that makes me sad is because I never yet had
a chance to show what I know about driving a
car. I took three lessons last spring, and later
on Thad might let me spell him some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get out first, if ever you do!&rdquo; vowed Giraffe;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to be splashed up against a wall, or
hoisted twenty feet up in the branches of a tree,
to hang there with my head down. And I don&rsquo;t
think Thad&rsquo;s reckless enough to take chances with
such a green driver. Bad enough as it is, with
a wobbly car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus did not answer, but there was an aggrieved
look on his round face, which would indicate
he did not agree with Giraffe at all, and still
considered that he might be trusted.</p>
<p>The sun, being well up, was beginning to prove
pretty warm, so that it was not surprising to hear
Giraffe express a desire for a cool drink.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Since such things as road-houses seem to be as
scarce as hens&rsquo; teeth along here, and you can&rsquo;t expect
to get any soda or sarsaparilla, suppose we keep
an eye out for a spring, and call a halt to water
our dusty throats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody seemed willing, and Bumpus even
went to the trouble to produce an old well-battered
tin cup he had picked up somewhere, as he remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you do run across a spring, Giraffe,
please fetch me that full of nice cold water, will
you? My leg still pains me, and I&rsquo;d better not get
out. I hate to give any one trouble, but it&rsquo;s a case
of necessity. Get your fill first, and fetch mine
when you come back to the car. You were always
a good friend of mine, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble at all,&rdquo; the other told him; &ldquo;but
first catch your rabbit before you start cooking the
same. We have yet to find the spring. Here, stop
making such faces, Bumpus; I know your throat
is full of dust, but you can&rsquo;t hurry things that
way, for even two swallows don&rsquo;t make a spring!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus pretended to feel faint after hearing
that, but recovered almost magically upon hearing
Thad say he believed he saw what they were looking
for up ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Belgian country people are always thinking
of others,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and they mark a spring
near the road with a white stone so passers-by can
know it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Allan, &ldquo;and ten chances to one we&rsquo;ll
find it as neat as wax, with some sort of a clean
mug to drink out of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope this isn&rsquo;t going to turn out a false clue,
that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;ve gone
and got my mouth watering for a drink, and the
disappointment might prove fatal to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two minutes afterwards they halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a spring, I do believe!&rdquo; said Giraffe,
making one of his flying leaps out of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you&rsquo;re forgetting all about my cup!&rdquo;
screeched Bumpus, and of course the impatient one
had to come back in order to keep his promise.</p>
<p>The spring was at some little distance from the
road, it being necessary to negotiate several fences
before reaching the white stone marking the spot
where the ice-cold water gurgled forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were wise not to try the venture, if your
leg pains you, Bumpus!&rdquo; Allan called back; and
the one left behind in the old car doubtless agreed
with him there.</p>
<p>Giraffe was swallowing his second cup when the
others arrived on the scene. He looked as though
he might be enjoying himself hugely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the water-wagon now!&rdquo; he warbled,
making way for them, and pointing to a stone mug
that lay close by for the use of thirsty travelers.</p>
<p>It was water that could hardly be excelled anywhere,
and Allan, filling the mug, insisted on Thad
drinking the contents. After that he dipped in for
himself, while Giraffe came along for his third
helping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One good turn deserves another!&rdquo; he chuckled;
&ldquo;and it seems as if I never could get enough of this
splendid stuff. I mustn&rsquo;t forget to fetch poor old
Bumpus his share, and if he wants more I&rsquo;ll have
to trot back here and get&mdash;&mdash; Hey! what&rsquo;s that
mean, Thad? The car&rsquo;s running away with Bumpus,
as sure as you&rsquo;re born!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trio by the spring stared for a few seconds
as though they thought they must be dreaming, for
it seemed utterly impossible that such a thing should
come to pass. And yet there was the car hurrying
along the road, with the fat scout clutching
the steering wheel, and looking half scared to death
as he tried to keep from running into the gullies
that lay to the right and to the left!</p>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">REPENTANT BUMPUS.</span></h2>
<p>There was no mystery attached to it all, and
Thad understood the whole occurrence as soon as
he saw the car moving down the road with Bumpus
in it. As usually happens, meddling was meeting
with its customary reward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Bumpus, as they very well knew, had long been
desirous of learning how to run a motor car. Of
course his father, being at the head of the Cranford
bank, owned a big car, and had a chauffeur
to run it; but he had issued positive orders that
under no conditions was the boy to be allowed to
ever handle the steering wheel. He knew Bumpus,
and his capacity for doing the wrong thing,
and meant to take no chances of having a
smash-up.</p>
<p>Boys are human. What is denied them they
most of all yearn to possess. Perhaps had Bumpus
never been restrained from trying to run a
car, his first little accident would have ended his
vaulting ambition. As it was, this desire fed on
the fact that it was a forbidden luxury for him.</p>
<p>When, therefore, Thad and the other two scouts
were making their way toward the spring, with
the intention of satisfying their thirst, he found
himself tempted to clamber awkwardly over into
the front seat, so as to sit there, and grasping the
steering wheel try to imagine himself a bold
chauffeur.</p>
<p>The engine was throbbing in restraint, and the
trembling motion of the car gave Bumpus an additional
opportunity to believe himself IT.</p>
<p>How he ever came to do it no one ever knew.
Bumpus himself was so startled when he felt the
car give a sudden leap forward that his wits almost
left him. He always stoutly maintained that,
so far as he could remember, he had done nothing
at all to influence the start, but of course this
was a mistake, for cars do not run away without
some help.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Bumpus still gripped that wheel in a frenzied
clutch. He stared hard at the road ahead, which
to his excited fancy seemed to consist of a zigzag
course as crooked as any wriggling snake he had
ever watched.</p>
<p>At one second it seemed as though he were headed
for the gully on the right, and no sooner had he
wildly given the wheel a turn than the car, in
sheer ugliness, Bumpus thought, started for the
other side of the road.</p>
<p>The ditch there did not look a bit more tempting
to the greenhorn chauffeur, and so he would
strive to avoid being overturned by a contrary whirl
of the wheel.</p>
<p>There he was going along at a rapid pace, with
the crazy car making the most eccentric dives and
plunges imaginable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After him!&rdquo; shouted Thad.</p>
<p>He feared for the car, but most of all he felt
great concern for Bumpus himself. With all his
faults, the fat boy was a general favorite among
his comrades of the Cranford Troop. In fact,
everybody liked him on account of his sunny nature,
his happy-go-lucky disposition, and his genial,
child-like and bland smile.</p>
<p>Hardly had Thad given this shout than all of
them were on the go. They did not attempt to
return to the road over the same course taken in
reaching the wayside spring, but started along a
diagonal line. This was to overcome the lead which
the runaway car had already obtained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Thad shouted out directions which if heard and
understood by Bumpus would have allowed him
to bring the car to a sudden stop. Perhaps in his
excitement the boy who clutched the steering wheel
could not make head or tail of what Thad was
calling. Then again it may have been the rattle
of the cranky old car prevented him from catching
the tenor of the directions.</p>
<p>In fact, as Bumpus afterwards frankly confessed,
it would have made little difference whether he
heard and understood the order or not. He only
had two hands, and they were both needed every
second of the time to keep that wheel moving,
and thus prevent an accident.</p>
<p>The three scouts found many obstacles in their
way from the spring to the road. They climbed
fences with a surprising agility, and mounted a
wall as though they were hounds coursing after a
hare.</p>
<p>The long-legged Giraffe proved himself to be a
trifle better than either of the others at this sort
of thing, and consequently he came upon the road
first. When Thad and Allan arrived he was some
little distance along, running like a deer, and utterly
regardless of the clouds of dust created by the
eccentric motions of the reckless runaway car.</p>
<p>Thad was used to judging distances, and after
making a rapid mental calculation he decided that,
barring some accident, Giraffe was sure to overtake
the car before many minutes had passed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>He only hoped they would come to no abrupt
bend in the road, where the inexperienced chauffeur
would lose what little command he now possessed
over his refractory vehicle.</p>
<p>Of course, Thad did not attempt to voice his opinion.
He needed every atom of breath he could get
in order to keep up that burst of speed; and, besides,
in that choking dust it would have been folly
to have opened his mouth.</p>
<p>The car was doing as well as at any time since
it came into their possession. Perhaps it meant
to show them that even a car may have feelings,
and resent constant slurs. Only for that zigzag
motion, which consumed more or less time, Giraffe
might have found it a much more difficult thing to
catch up with the runaway.</p>
<p>More than once it seemed to Thad that his heart
was trying to crowd up into his throat and choke
him. This came about whenever he saw Bumpus
make a more desperate lunge than usual and come
within an ace of landing in the ditch, the car
wrecked, and his own neck placed in extreme peril
of being broken.</p>
<p>As Giraffe afterwards privately said, &ldquo;There
seems to be an especial little cherub aloft given the
task of protecting children and fools&rdquo;; and, if this
were true, the angelic being had Bumpus in charge
on that wild run.</p>
<p>Now Giraffe by dint of a spurt was close behind
the car. Thad still chasing after, with Allan close
beside him, waited in suspense to see how the tall
comrade would manage. He knew just how he
would act under similar conditions, and had enough
faith in Giraffe to believe he could do at least as
well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>They saw him lay hands on the rear of the car.
Then he seemed to make a mighty effort, and the
next thing they knew he was clambering, scrambling,
getting aboard any way at all, so that he
accomplished his aim.</p>
<p>No doubt he was also holding his peace so that
poor, clumsy Bumpus might not be still further
&ldquo;rattled&rdquo; with the knowledge that help had arrived
in his sore extremity.</p>
<p>Then all at once Giraffe was seen to bend over
and clutch the steering wheel. It was heartening
to notice how quickly the car stopped that erratic
wabbling, and settled down to doing a fairly
straight run.</p>
<p>No doubt Giraffe was not telling Bumpus just
what he must do with his freed hands, for they
saw the fat boy lean over, while the car began to
run slower and slower until it came to a dead stop.</p>
<p>Then for the first time did Thad allow himself
to say a word. The relief from all that suspense
was so great that he had to give expression to his
satisfaction, which he did by gasping:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, he did it&mdash;bully for Giraffe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sometimes pays to have <i>extra</i> long legs!&rdquo; was
the characteristic remark made by Allan, as they
both ran on, though at a reduced pace.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the now motionless car
they found an extremely repentant Bumpus awaiting
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me how it happened, Thad,&rdquo; he said
sadly, &ldquo;because I don&rsquo;t know. I was sitting there,
turning the wheel this way and that, and trying to
imagine how it felt to be a real chauffeur, when
all at once she gave a snort and a kick, just like
an army mule that feels the lash, and commenced
to start whizzing along the road. Oh! look at me,
soaking wet with perspiration. Whew! I&rsquo;ve had
a lesson I won&rsquo;t forget in a hurry. You don&rsquo;t
catch me fooling with a buzz saw again in a hurry,
I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With such a contrite culprit owning up to his
faults what could Thad say? To scold Bumpus
seemed almost cruel, and besides, Thad was feeling
too well pleased over the successful outcome of
the adventure to hurt the poor fellow&rsquo;s feelings any
more than was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Giraffe was not quite so tenderhearted, though
feeling flushed with satisfaction over his recent
victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you know now why your dad wouldn&rsquo;t
let you learn to run your big touring car at home,
don&rsquo;t you, Bumpus?&rdquo; he jeered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think he knew a heap better
than I did about it,&rdquo; admitted the humble Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes brains to run a car,&rdquo; asserted Giraffe
meaningly. &ldquo;Some people never should try it, because
they get rattled at the least little thing out
of the ordinary, and go all to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Bumpus heaved a great sigh; then one of his
old-time smiles crept over his face, now white no
longer on account of alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m mighty glad I didn&rsquo;t quite do that,
Giraffe, by bringing up in the ditch, you know,&rdquo;
he started to say. &ldquo;Gimme a little credit for escaping
smashing things to splinters. And, Giraffe,
I want to say that I&rsquo;m ever so much obliged to you
for doing what you did. It was a noble deed, and
there are few fellows who could have carried it
out half as well as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that splendid compliment, of course there
was no use of Giraffe feeling hard toward the one
who had just given them all such a scare. He
smiled back at Bumpus, and the subject was
dropped, so far as finding fault or laying down the
law went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do now, Thad?&rdquo; asked Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might go back again to where we were,&rdquo;
suggested the other, with a curious look toward
Bumpus, which the other noticed, and understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for, Thad?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re
meaning to let me get a drink, I refuse to allow
it. I&rsquo;m going dry, to make up in part for what
I did. Serves me right, and I&rsquo;ll get it rubbed in
all the time I&rsquo;m being half choked by the dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad saw he meant it, too, and knew that Bumpus
could be very stubborn when he wanted to.
Besides, perhaps it would be just as well for him
to punish himself in this way, since the more he
suffered the less likelihood there was of the incident
being repeated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say, Bumpus,&rdquo; he remarked, as he
climbed into the car again; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll keep our eyes
on the watch for a chance to stop at one of these
cottages where they have a well in the yard, and
you can get a drink there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Thad; it&rsquo;s a lot more than I deserve,&rdquo;
said Bumpus; &ldquo;but I tell you I had the
surprise of my life when she gave that snort, and
started to run away with me. I&rsquo;m shivering yet
with the excitement; just feel my hand, will you,
Giraffe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another start was made, everybody feeling satisfied
that there had been no serious outcome of
the adventure. To have had the car put out of
the running would have caused them considerable
distress; but they might have even forgiven that if
only their jolly chum came through the accident unscathed.</p>
<p>It was really Thad himself who discovered a
wayside cottage, with a well in the yard. Possibly
Bumpus, bent on severe atonement, would never
have called their attention to the same if he had
been the only one to glimpse it.</p>
<p>He even began to demur when Thad said they
would stop and ask for a drink; but Giraffe told
him not to be foolish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we want you to get choking pretty soon,
and scare us half to death?&rdquo; he told the fat boy
severely; but then Bumpus knew very well this
was all assumed, and that Giraffe really wanted him
to assuage his raging thirst.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>So they came to a stop, and when a woman
accompanied by several children came out of the
cottage, Thad managed by signs to ask permission
to drink at her well. She quickly understood what
he wanted, and nodded an assent, even starting to
draw a fresh bucket of water, though Thad took
the rope from her hands, and completed the job.</p>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">MORE HARD LUCK.</span></h2>
<p>During the next few hours they made progress,
but the distance covered did not count for many
miles. There were several reasons for this. In
the first place Thad found he had made a mistake
in the road, for his chart was not as accurate as it
should have been, and of course to rectify this they
had to go back and try it all over again.</p>
<p>Then Giraffe complained of being hungry, and
that necessitated looking for some place where they
might get something to eat. Coming to a village
finally, they saw another tavern, and as money
&ldquo;talks&rdquo; with people who keep caravansaries of any
sort, arrangements were made whereby they might
be supplied with a meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>So an hour and more was consumed in waiting
for this to be cooked, and in afterwards eating the
same. No one, however, begrudged the time or
the money, for what they had proved to be quite
appetizing, with its flavor of French cookery.</p>
<p>Another cause for delay consisted in the fact
that the road they were following mounted several
rises, and as they had already learned, to their
cost, the tricky old car disliked hill climbing above
all things. So they were compelled to display their
scout knowledge of &ldquo;first aid to the injured&rdquo; in
the way of lending a helping hand.</p>
<p>They came upon many people as they pursued
their way. Some were going in the same direction
as the boys, while others came from the opposite
quarter. They could not help noticing that all
looked unusually excited; while some of them
seemed to be carrying heavy burdens. These were
doubtless possessed with the idea that the German
cavalrymen would be raiding through that entire
section at any time now, and if they hoped to save
their most cherished possessions it was time they
took them to some place of security.</p>
<p>The day was passing, and only another hour remained
for them to push on. Thad was not at
all satisfied with the poor progress they had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try and do better to-morrow,&rdquo; he told
them as they jogged along, the engine making
more noise than ever, it seemed. &ldquo;If only we can
get to a point where there&rsquo;s no danger of being
stopped by commands of raiding Uhlans we can
figure on reaching our destination&mdash;hello! what&rsquo;s
gone wrong now, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>The engine had given a last weak throb and refused
to carry on the work any longer. Thad,
Allan and Giraffe all jumped out and started to
investigate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! ginger! what do you think of that?&rdquo; the
last named was heard to exclaim, as though he had
made a startling and unexpected discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Giraffe?&rdquo; asked Bumpus, who had
not descended from the car, but for all that was
deeply interested in everything that went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tank&rsquo;s clean empty!&rdquo; burst from Giraffe.</p>
<p>Thad and Allen stared hard at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be mistaken, Giraffe,&rdquo; said the former.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly have made a bad guess,&rdquo; added
Allan, &ldquo;because we put in five gallons just an hour
ago, and couldn&rsquo;t possibly have used more than a
third of that amount by now. Try again, Giraffe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for yourself,&rdquo; said the tall boy, with a
shrug of his shoulders that stood for disgust, and
perhaps a little indignation as well, that his word
should be doubted.</p>
<p>An investigation revealed the fact that there
was hardly a drop in the tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the reason,&rdquo; said Thad, pointing with
his finger to where plain signs of a leak could be
seen; &ldquo;the reservoir has gone back on us. It must
have sprung that leak in the last mile or two, and
drained the tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what tough luck!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpus, and
then settled back in his seat in the consciousness
that these comrades, so fertile in resources, would
speedily find some solution for the problem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Thad glanced at Allan, shook his head, and smiled
dismally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if we&rsquo;re bound to run the whole gamut
of car troubles before we&rsquo;re done with this machine,
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Of course there
are several things we might do. One is to pull the
car aside so as not to block the road, and then strike
on in hopes of finding a village, where we can either
put up for the night or else get some gas, enough
to bring us on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Failing that,&rdquo; said Giraffe, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s to hinder
hiring a farmer and his horse to pull the machine
along to town? It&rsquo;s a common occurrence over in
our country, and these Belgians are ready to do
anything like that to earn a dollar or two. And if
you say the word, Thad, I&rsquo;ll be glad to strike off
right now to either get the juice or hire a horse to
tow us out of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was always the way with Giraffe, for there
never breathed a more willing comrade than the
tall scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice of you to make that offer, Giraffe,&rdquo; the
patrol leader told him, &ldquo;and I guess we&rsquo;ll have to
take you up on it, since there seems to be no other
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d find it pretty tough to try and push the
car a long ways,&rdquo; ventured Bumpus, always remembering
the effort it took to surmount the low hills
they had struck; &ldquo;and as to camping out here without
a bite of supper, I&rsquo;d rather be excused from trying
it, even if I had to go for help myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Of course no one would dream of allowing such
a thing as this last hint covered; and doubtless
Bumpus knew that he was perfectly safe in making
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I go, do I, Thad?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, looking
actually pleased at the chance to make himself &ldquo;useful
as well as ornamental,&rdquo; as he himself called it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you will,&rdquo; he was told; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll promise
to stay here and watch the car, though it&rsquo;d be hard
for any one to steal it without a bit of petrol in
the tank to run the engine. Take your time, Giraffe;
no need of sprinting. If you can&rsquo;t get the
gasoline, bring a horse and a driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not so very proud!&rdquo; laughed Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only be another experience,&rdquo; ventured Allan;
being boys they could grapple with troubles
without being greatly discouraged, for as is often
the case they saw something of a frolic in each
successive adventure, something to be remembered
and retold later on with more or less pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re away, Giraffe,&rdquo; continued Thad,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see if we can mend the hole in the petrol tank.
I believe I saw a little soldering outfit in the kit of
tools. Just as like as not this isn&rsquo;t the first rust
hole that&rsquo;s happened in that same old tank. If we
can&rsquo;t do it, some plumber will have to undertake
the job, for we can&rsquo;t go ahead otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>So Giraffe walked on, taking great strides with
those long legs of his. Bumpus, who being so
stout only made mincing steps, always declared
Giraffe must have inherited the famous Seven
League Boots they used to read about in the fairy
story books.</p>
<p>Giraffe waved his hand back to his comrades before
turning a bend, and that was the last they saw
of him on his mission for help.</p>
<p>Thad and Allan were soon busily engaged. They
made a little fire close by, where the small soldering
iron could be heated. Bumpus having asked if he
could be of any assistance, and being told to the
contrary, solaced himself by sitting there and watching
all they did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No telling but what I might want to mend a hole
in a coffee pot some of these fine days,&rdquo; he remarked,
complacently, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s just as well that I
learn how to handle the tools. I believe in a scout&rsquo;s
knowing things every time&rdquo;; then as though his conscience
suddenly smote him he hurriedly added:
&ldquo;but once in a while you may run up against a snag,
like I did when I fooled with that driving wheel.
Think you c&rsquo;n fix it, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It begins to look that way, Bumpus,&rdquo; the other
told him; &ldquo;we seem to be making some progress,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we&rsquo;ll get the hole mended all right,&rdquo; Allan
remarked, confidently; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s always going to
be a question how soon another will come along.
The tank is worn out, and not worth much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can only hope it serves our purpose, and
after that who cares?&rdquo; ventured the now philosophical
Bumpus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>In the end the leak was repaired, and so far as
they could see the tank would do its duty again as
a reservoir, providing any petrol was to be had.</p>
<p>By this time the boys were thinking they ought
to see something of their messenger. Giraffe would
surely have had plenty of time to run across some
wayside cottage where they had a horse that could
be hired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect,&rdquo; Thad explained, to account for the
delay, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got his mind set on getting some juice,
and so he&rsquo;s gone on to the next town. Well, if he
fetches it with him we&rsquo;ll get along in a hurry all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sitting there in the car, which had been dragged
to one side of the road, they settled down to wait.
The day was done, and with the setting of the sun
thoughts of supper naturally came into the mind of
Bumpus, because that fierce appetite of his gave
him little peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if he doesn&rsquo;t show up to-night, Thad?&rdquo;
he remarked, voicing a fear that had latterly been
tugging at his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it doesn&rsquo;t come to that,&rdquo; replied the
other, looking serious. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d be worried about
him. Of course we can put up the top of the car.
It&rsquo;s a pretty ragged top at that, but would keep the
dew from falling on us. As scouts we&rsquo;ve camped
out in a good many queer places, and ought to
stand a little thing like that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Bumpus did not much relish the prospect, but being
a wise fellow he kept his disappointment to himself.
The minutes crept on, and pretty soon darkness
had engulfed the stalled car. Still no Giraffe.
It looked very strange, for they could not imagine
what might have happened to their chum.</p>
<p>Another hour passed.</p>
<p>The moon even peeped into view over in the east,
and there was no welcome hail in the cheery voice
of the absent chum. Bumpus gave himself up to
the most agonizing speculations. He possibly saw,
in his mind, poor Giraffe undergoing all manner
of tortures, from being shot as a German spy on
account of having tried to converse with some one
in the Teuton language, to being taken prisoner by
a band of raiding Uhlans.</p>
<p>And while engaged in thinking of all these things
Bumpus actually fell asleep. He could do that about
as easily as any one Thad had ever known. Hearing
his regular breathing, and seeing that Bumpus
was lying back in the corner under the hood which
had been raised, Thad gently placed the one thin
cover they possessed over the sleeper; and after that
when he and Allan wanted to converse they lowered
their voices so as not to disturb Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think has gone wrong, Thad?&rdquo;
Allan asked, as though not fully satisfied with his
own conclusions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;but let&rsquo;s
hope it&rsquo;s only because Giraffe is dead set on getting
the juice, and nothing else will suit him. We know
once he makes up his mind he can be dreadfully
stubborn, almost as bad as Bumpus here, for a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>After that they sat there and exchanged sentences
only once in a while. The time was August, but all
the same the night air began to feel more or less
cool; and Thad was even wondering whether it
would not be a good idea to resurrect the fire they
had used for heating the iron, so as to ward off
this chill, when suddenly he heard sounds along the
road that gave him a thrill.</p>
<p>Instantly his hand sought the arm of his chum.
Allan may have been half dozing, but as he felt
that warning touch he was instantly wide awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; whispered Thad.</p>
<p>More plainly than before came the sounds, and
Allan, too, was thrilled when he made out what
seemed to be voices, mingled with a clanking noise
such as would be made by soldiers bearing arms.
Yes, and now he plainly caught the thud of horses&rsquo;
hoofs on the hard road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit tight!&rdquo; said Thad; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing we can
do to help ourselves. Even if it is soldiers they may
be Belgians maneuvering to get in the rear of the
Germans. But we&rsquo;ll soon know the worst, for the
sounds are coming closer all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, sitting there while Bumpus slept peacefully
on, the two chums awaited the explanation of the
mystery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">AT THE END OF A TOW LINE.</span></h2>
<p>This state of uncertainty was of short duration.
Then Thad chuckled softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly heard Giraffe&rsquo;s laugh then,&rdquo; he told
Allan; &ldquo;and you can tell now it&rsquo;s only a single horse
that&rsquo;s thumping along. After all Giraffe had to
give up on the petrol business, and come down to
getting us towed in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon they could see moving figures on the road,
and catch the creak of heavy wheels much in need
of axle grease. It proved to be a cart, and seated
in the same was Giraffe, together with a couple of
half-grown Belgian lads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I was never coming, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the
tall scout remarked, as he jumped to the road;
&ldquo;well, I kept trying to get some gas all through the
village, but it was no use. When I contracted to
buy a supply I must have bitten off a bigger wad
than I could chew. And I had a number of things
happen, too; tell you about the same later on. Now,
we&rsquo;ll get busy hitching our chariot to a star. This
was really the best I could do, Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was of course assured that no one dreamed
of blaming him; and that they would be very well
satisfied to get somewhere or other, no matter what
the means of locomotion turned out to be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>The two stout Belgian boys soon managed with
the help of Giraffe to fasten the stalled car to the
rear of their queer-looking cart. Ropes had been
brought along for that very purpose, Giraffe foreseeing
the need of such things.</p>
<p>When the start was made the car gave a jerk.
That served to arouse Bumpus, who had continued
to sleep calmly on despite all the talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! so we&rsquo;re going on again, are we? Did
Giraffe fetch the stuff, and&mdash;my stars! whatever
is that ahead of us; and a towing rope in the bargain?
Oh! I see now; we&rsquo;re being carted into town,
for a fact!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe was full of his recent hunt for liquid fuel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw the beat,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;how everybody
wants to hold on to what little petrol they&rsquo;ve
got. I offered double price, but they shook their
heads and as near as I could understand tried to
tell me they needed every drop for their own use.
Now that the war has broken out nobody knows
what will happen. After chasing around till I was
tired out, I made up my mind it was a case of the
tow-line for us, or stay out here all night. I took
the tow, and here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far away is the town you mention?&rdquo; asked
Thad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All of two miles,&rdquo; he was told; &ldquo;but it wasn&rsquo;t
the distance that kept me. I had to waste so much
time trying to make them understand. Then one
party would direct me to a certain house where I
might buy some petrol. Result, half an hour wasted
and not a thing gained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there an inn in that town, Giraffe?&rdquo; asked
Bumpus, softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking about your grub, ain&rsquo;t you, Bumpus?&rdquo;
chuckled the other; &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s all right. There&rsquo;s
an inn, and I told the landlord we might show up
later on. He even promised to cook us some supper
when we came, charging extra for the same, you
understand, Bumpus. It was in front of that same
inn I saw the soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Germans?&rdquo; asked Allan, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, a Belgian battery of field guns that is heading
for the fighting line,&rdquo; the late messenger explained.
&ldquo;They came in with a whirl while I was
there, and watered the horses dragging the guns at
the trough in front of the inn. It made a pretty
sight, let me tell you, for the moon was just rising.
I&rsquo;ll never forget it as long as I live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t offer to bother you, did they, Giraffe?&rdquo;
asked Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the other, scornfully.
&ldquo;Why, I soon found that one of the gunners could
speak pretty good English, and I had quite a little
talk fest with him while the horses were drinking
their fill at that trough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you pick up any information worth while,
Giraffe?&rdquo; asked Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I got only made me feel sour,&rdquo; the other
replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why should it, Giraffe?&rdquo; Bumpus wanted to
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I was told the Germans seemed to be
sending out thousands of their hard-riding cavalrymen
to scatter through this part of the country and
terrorize the people,&rdquo; explained Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would be another meaning to such a
move, I should think,&rdquo; ventured Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are there, Thad,&rdquo; continued the other.
&ldquo;That gunner let me understand it was believed
the Germans, being held up so fiercely by the forts
at Li&eacute;ge, were trying to make a flank movement
so as to threaten Brussels from this side. And
Thad, he said there wasn&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n one chance in
ten we&rsquo;d ever be able to get through the lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that, Giraffe,&rdquo; remarked the
patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t mean to give up yet, do we?&rdquo;
queried Bumpus, who never liked to quit; he had
plenty of faults, but that of yielding could hardly
be called one of his shortcomings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like it,&rdquo; admitted Thad; &ldquo;for
we&rsquo;ve got our tank mended, and if there&rsquo;s any gasoline
to be had for love or money we&rsquo;ll push on to-morrow,
taking what comes, and making the best
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And always remembering,&rdquo; said Giraffe, &ldquo;that
in case the worst comes we can go back to the Dutch
border, cross over, and make for Rotterdam. That&rsquo;s
what the Belgian gunner told me. He was a fine
young chap, and if he comes through the fighting
all right I expect to hear from him after I get home
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he never did, Giraffe was later on forced to
the sad conviction that his new-found friend must
have given up his young life in defence of his beloved
country, as thousands of others did likewise.</p>
<p>They continued to talk as they made slow progress.
It was snail-like, after having become accustomed
to the ten-mile-an-hour gait of the car,
when it was doing its best. Still, no one complained,
for half a loaf was a good deal better than
no bread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d a lot sooner be caught in this fix than to stay
out there all night, crammed in the car,&rdquo; remarked
Bumpus, and then continuing he said, with a vein
of reproach in his mellow voice: &ldquo;but, Thad, Allan,
it wasn&rsquo;t just right for you to tuck the only wrap
we had along around me, like I was a big baby.
I&rsquo;ve got to learn to take my knocks like the rest of
you, and I want you to let me meet my share, or
else I&rsquo;ll be unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, we&rsquo;re getting close to the village now,&rdquo;
said Giraffe, pointing to where houses could be
dimly seen in the misty moonlight.</p>
<p>The hour was pretty late when they hauled up in
the inn-yard. The landlord had kept his word, and
supper was being cooked even then, a fact Bumpus
discovered as soon as he could scent the odors in
the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! mebbe I&rsquo;m not glad you decided to take a
horse when you couldn&rsquo;t get any gas, Giraffe,&rdquo; he
remarked, sniffing vigorously; &ldquo;now, I wonder what
he&rsquo;s having cooked for us. If it&rsquo;s as good as the
stuff we had at noon I&rsquo;m going to find out how it&rsquo;s
made. Then some time or other when we&rsquo;re camping
out with the rest of the boys I&rsquo;ll spring a big
surprise on you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that everything considered,&rdquo; said Thad,
&ldquo;we have reason to be thankful things are no worse.
So far as I can see there&rsquo;s been no damage done;
and here&rsquo;s the landlord coming to tell us supper is
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Bumpus, you forget that you&rsquo;ve got a
game leg, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; called out Giraffe, as the
fat boy jumped to his feet in readiness for a rush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s got well again,&rdquo; Bumpus assured him
blandly. &ldquo;Fact is, the scare I had when I was run
away with by that car did the business for that
lame leg. But if both of them happened to be
crippled that wouldn&rsquo;t keep me from feeling hungry,
would it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since no one had ever known anything to do
this of course there was no chance for Giraffe to
make any response. The supper turned out to have
the same appetizing flavor which Bumpus had so
much admired at noon, and after a great deal of
effort Giraffe managed to extract the information
from the landlord that it was all a little French
trick of rubbing a bit of garlic on the pan in which
the food was being cooked, and which gave it that
flavor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see all sorts of trouble ahead for us scouts,&rdquo;
ventured Giraffe, after he had imparted this information
to Bumpus, &ldquo;if ever he takes to carrying a
string of garlic along with him on our hikes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They really enjoyed that supper immensely. Possibly
it was because they had such keen appetites
after waiting so long in the cool night air; but no
matter what the cause they left the table satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next thing is to get some sleep,&rdquo; remarked
Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to step out a bit first, Bumpus, and
push the car under a shed, so it will be hidden,&rdquo;
Allan told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we don&rsquo;t have to lie around again to guard
the same, I hope,&rdquo; suggested the fat scout, who was
hoping to have clean sheets and a mattress for a
change, instead of just ordinary hay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ve decided to cut that out this time,&rdquo;
Thad explained, &ldquo;because we don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s
going to be any stealing done. I&rsquo;ll cripple the machine
again by taking away some part; and with
no petrol aboard it ought to be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were given a couple of large rooms that
overlooked the front of the house. When Thad
thrust his head out of a window he could see the
road, and the watering trough where as Giraffe had
told them the horses of the Belgian field battery
rushing to the front had stopped to drink.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>All seemed peaceful and quiet. If a dog barked
occasionally, or a nearby rooster gave vent to a few
crows, as was his habit at certain hours of the
night, none of the tired lads were likely to pay any
attention to such common sounds. They figured that
given two more days, with as much progress accomplished
as had marked the one just passed, and
they should be beyond the danger line, with what
could be called a clear field ahead of them.</p>
<p>So doubtless as they settled themselves to sleep,
two in each room, and with good clean and comfortable
beds under them, their last thoughts must
have been of hopes for the morrow, and wishes for
as few interruptions as possible.</p>
<p>Allan was Thad&rsquo;s bed-fellow, which of course
left Bumpus and Giraffe to pair off&mdash;&ldquo;the fat and
the lean,&rdquo; as the tall boy remarked when proceeding
to get most of his clothes off and try that &ldquo;dandy-looking
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad could not go to sleep very easily, for a
wonder. It was not that he had any reason to
anticipate coming trouble, for as far as he could
see there was nothing of the sort in sight. So many
things persisted in crowding into his mind that for
once his plan of settling down did not seem to
work very well.</p>
<p>It must have been fully eleven o&rsquo;clock before he
dropped off; and the last thing he remembered hearing
was a series of odd little snorts coming from
the adjoining room, which he knew must be caused
by Bumpus lying on his back. Giraffe on his part
was certainly sound asleep, or he would never have
stood for such noises.</p>
<p>Then Thad awoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>He heard the clatter of many horses&rsquo; hoofs outside,
together with the jangling of accoutrements.
It gave him a shock and he immediately sat upright
in bed. This awoke Allan, and he copied Thad&rsquo;s
example as soon as he caught the strange and significant
noises coming in through the open windows.</p>
<p>As the two boys sat there listening, hardly knowing
what all this rattle of iron-shod hoofs might
signify, they heard a loud voice give a command,
which was evidently intended as &ldquo;halt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What thrilled Thad and his chum, however, was
that the order was not given in English, French
or Flemish but in plain, unmistakable German.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kaiser&rsquo;s men have struck this place, Allan!&rdquo;
said Thad, as with quivering hands he threw back
the bed clothes, and jumping out started toward
the window, bent upon seeing what it meant.</p>
<p>Allan was at his heels, and upon reaching the
open window they looked out, to discover a sight
that was calculated to impress them so strongly that
it could never be forgotten.</p>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">THE GERMAN RAIDERS.</span></h2>
<p>The moon was well up in the heavens and this
made it almost as light as day out there in the open.
Both the scouts could see that scores and scores of
men mounted on fine horses had halted for a breathing
spell. Down by the pump as many horses as
could gather around were drinking their fill at the
very trough where only a few hours before the
animals drawing the guns of the Belgians had
stood, according to what Giraffe had told them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>Crouching there in the window the boys stared
and listened and took it all in. It happened that
the moon was on the other side of the inn so that
the wall here was well in shadow. This prevented
Thad and Allan from being noticed, and they had
the good sense to remain perfectly still so as not
to attract undue attention.</p>
<p>There could be no telling what these hard-riding
Uhlans might do. Doubtless nine-tenths of all the
terrible stories told about their cruel work could
be set down as pure fiction; but even then some
among them might be reckless enough to fire a
shot at a shrinking figure, half seen in a window,
under the impression that it might turn out to be a
&ldquo;sniper&rdquo; getting ready to shoot into their ranks.</p>
<p>The landlord had come out, and was now talking
with one of those who seemed to be in charge of
the band. None of the boys had known up to this
time he could speak German; and Giraffe in particular
would be surprised to know it, for had he
only been aware of the fact on his previous visit it
would have saved him much time and effort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>When Thad remembered about the Belgian battery
having been on the identical spot such a short
time before he was strongly impressed with the
strange vicissitudes and contrasts of war. And had
that same battery but lingered in hiding it would
have been in a position to strike a blow at the invaders
not often encountered.</p>
<p>Remembering that they had companions in the
other room Thad started to creep through the connecting
door, with the intention of waking them.
Then they too could afterwards boast of having
looked upon a band of those dashing hard riders
known as Uhlans, and who with the Russian Cossacks
have had the reputation of being the most
terrible fighters of all Europe.</p>
<p>He had his trouble for his pains, for he found the
bed in the other room empty, with Giraffe and Bumpus
over at the window watching all that was going
on below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, and don&rsquo;t draw any attention if you
can help it,&rdquo; Thad whispered to the others as he
reached the spot where they crouched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the officers are coming inside,&rdquo; said
Giraffe; &ldquo;I reckon they&rsquo;ve ordered the landlord to
fetch up his best wines. It would be just like them
to make him clean up his wine cellar for the benefit
of the troop. And just our luck not to have
paid our bill yet; for he&rsquo;s bound to make good his
losses on his guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! let us hope they won&rsquo;t think to set fire to
the inn, because his stock of drinks gives out,&rdquo;
whimpered Bumpus, doubtless already picturing in
his mind what sort of work he could make of climbing
out of the window and down the water pipe,
in case such a dreadful catastrophe did come about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you&rsquo;re shivering at the window, fellows,&rdquo;
whispered Thad; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d advise you to go and get
a blanket over your shoulders, if you want to stay
and see all that happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll burn the house, do you,
Thad?&rdquo; asked Bumpus; &ldquo;I want to know, because
it&rsquo;d take me some little time making a rope ladder
out of the sheets. That&rsquo;s the best way to get down
from here, because it&rsquo;d be too big a drop for a
fellow like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; Giraffe told him;
&ldquo;there won&rsquo;t be any burning done. You stand more
chance of freezing to death right now; so get that
blanket, Bumpus. Hold on, stay where you are, and
I&rsquo;ll fetch one for you; it isn&rsquo;t safe to have you
moving around so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad soon went back to his own room and provided
himself with the bed covers which he divided
with Allan. There was really nothing new to report.
More men and horses kept pushing up to the
pump and the water trough. The handle of the former
kept up a continual groaning as strong arms
worked it constantly, to keep the trough from running
dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here the officers come out again,&rdquo; remarked
Allan; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve had their wine, and mean to let the
landlord off easy this time. Perhaps they&rsquo;re in too
big a hurry to stay long in one place. That was
the call to mount we just heard. And, Thad, this
is about as thrilling a scene as we&rsquo;ve ever looked at.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added the other, &ldquo;and inside of a week
half of those fine strapping big fellows may be dead,
for all we know. They take their lives in their
hands when they go galloping across an enemy&rsquo;s
country this way. Any hour they are likely to find
themselves in a trap, with deadly rapid-fire guns
pouring a hail of bullets into the troop, cutting down
horses and men. It&rsquo;s terrible just to think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They saw the Uhlans begin to gallop away, with
a sense of great relief. The little pennons at the
ends of their long lances fluttered in the night air.
Seen in the mellow moonlight it was an inspiring
picture that made the hearts of the onlookers beat
faster than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that, though,&rdquo; Thad was muttering
as he watched, with the last of the troop leaving
the watering trough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Thad,&rdquo; demanded Allan, who had
just barely caught the low words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see which way they&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; asked
the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they seem to have come into town from
the left-hand road, and are leaving by the one that
runs toward the southwest,&rdquo; replied Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s our course to-morrow, you know,&rdquo;
Thad continued, with a meaning in his voice that
could not well be mistaken.</p>
<p>Allan gave a low whistle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see now what you mean, Thad,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;It begins to look as if that Belgian gunner Giraffe
talked with knew what he was saying when he said
we didn&rsquo;t have more than one chance in ten to slip
through. If there are many more detachments of
Uhlans like this floating around, so as to fairly cover
the country, we&rsquo;ll be hauled up as sure as anything,
and chased back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because they&rsquo;d be afraid we might carry
important news to the enemy, and set the Belgians
on their trail,&rdquo; Thad went on to say.</p>
<p>They had no further reason for staying up in the
chilly night air, with a comfortable bed so close at
hand, and a few minutes later the two chums were
tucked under the covers once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think they bothered our car, do you,
Thad?&rdquo; asked Allan, as he prepared to coax further
sleep to visit his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; he was told. &ldquo;I did see several of
the men go into the shed and move around the
stables, but they must have been looking for sound
horses, and not broken-down wrecks of cars. As
they didn&rsquo;t carry off any horses that I could see I
reckon all the good ones have already been taken
for the Belgian cavalry and field batteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When eventually morning came it found all the
scouts up bright and early. Even Bumpus astonished
his mates by showing no desire to remain in
bed after being aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course we&rsquo;re going on, boys,&rdquo; he decided, as they
were dressing; &ldquo;just because there&rsquo;s a bunch of
German rough-riders cruising around these parts
isn&rsquo;t enough to make us back down and show the
white feather, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>They all assured him that so far no one thought
of doing such a thing, which information doubtless
gave Bumpus more or less satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like to promise that we&rsquo;ll be able to
break through, though, Bumpus,&rdquo; Thad warned him.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all going to depend on how the Germans have
scattered over the country down in that direction.
If we have a lot of luck we&rsquo;ll escape them; but don&rsquo;t
forget that we&rsquo;ve still another scheme up our sleeve
in case this one fails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This fleeting visit by a troop of the enemy had
aroused the Belgian village as nothing that had
ever before occurred could have done. The women
were out gossiping over the low fences, or else gabbling
in groups in front of the houses. Boys, old
men, and those who from some physical defect were
debarred from participating in the active service of
the army could be seen talking in knots.</p>
<p>Although as yet they had not heard the crash of
gun, and seen men falling in scores before the
modern rapid-fire guns, or those using shrapnel, it
was getting pretty close to the border line with
them. To have two rival forces visit the quaint and
peaceful place only a few hours apart brought the
war home to those who dwelt in the little Belgian
town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Giraffe had been greatly impressed. He was by
nature a pugnacious sort of a boy, and it had always
been a hard thing for him to subdue his passion
when he first subscribed to the twelve cardinal
rules that govern the life of a scout. Now
and then that old spirit would persist in cropping
out again, in defiance to the law of the scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; he was saying this morning,
when, after eating breakfast at the inn, the boys
started out in a bunch with an empty five-gallon can,
determined to pick up enough petrol in small lots to
serve to carry them over a good many miles of
Belgian territory; &ldquo;tell you what, fellows, I&rsquo;ll be
pretty much disappointed and broken-hearted if
after being so near the firing line I don&rsquo;t get a
chance to glimpse just one solitary battle between
these Belgians end the Germans. Somehow I&rsquo;ve got
a hunch that King Albert and his boys can put up
a good article of scrap; and from what we&rsquo;ve heard
they&rsquo;re giving the Kaiser the surprise of his life
over at Li&eacute;ge right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad told him he was foolish to wish that, because
a battle was a terrible thing, and apt to give
him a fit of the horrors every time he remembered
what he saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Sherman knew what war was when he
called it a pretty hard name,&rdquo; the scout master
continued, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s silly for a boy to want to see
men shot down as if they were ripe grain. A scout
should know better than that, Giraffe, you want to
remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe did not make any reply, but from his
manner it was plain to be seen that he was far from
being convinced by Thad&rsquo;s logic. What was bred in
the bone it was very hard to beat out of the flesh;
and in other days Giraffe had even owned a game
rooster which he had proudly boasted could whip
any barnyard fowl in and around Cranford.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>They first got a few hints from the landlord,
and then started out to try and get enough petrol
to give them a fair start. Sometimes they met with
luck, and then again their mission proved just as
fruitless as had Giraffe&rsquo;s on the preceding evening
when on the way to this same town.</p>
<p>Still, when half an hour passed and they had managed
to buy four gallons they considered that they
were doing very well indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can double that in the same length of
time we&rsquo;ll consider ourselves pretty lucky,&rdquo; said
Thad; &ldquo;but no matter how we come out we&rsquo;re going
to start about that time. Every chance we get
on the road we can stop and hold up the little sign
our friend the landlord has made for us, and which
reads: &lsquo;We want to buy a gallon or more of petrol,
and will pay twice the regular price for it. We are
American Boy Scouts trying to reach Antwerp.
Help us out.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took turns in carrying the can which was
by this time beginning to feel rather weighty. Even
Bumpus insisted on taking his regular spell, for
when they tried to spare him from doing his share
of things he always grew indignant, and wanted
to know why they tried to make him out to be a
baby. Bumpus was getting to be exceedingly
touchy on such matters, it seemed, for his pride
received a severe jolt every time it happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>When the next half hour had expired and Thad
told them they must go back to the inn so as to
make a start they had close on seven gallons of
petrol. Apparently the fluid famine had already
started in that part of little Belgium, and it was certain
to get worse continually as the bitter war
went on.</p>
<p>The scouts quitted their refuge of the night, feeling
that they had passed through another novel experience
in watching the coming and going of the
raiding Uhlan troop.</p>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">A MAN IN THE TREE TOP.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;To-day ought to tell the story whether we&rsquo;re
going to get through or not,&rdquo; Giraffe was saying,
after they had been making more or less progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it a little stronger, Giraffe,&rdquo; ventured Thad.
&ldquo;Say to-day and to-morrow will go pretty far
toward settling it; because with such a knock-down
machine we&rsquo;re apt to meet up with all sorts of
delays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ll be glad when the agony is over,&rdquo;
he remarked pensively; and there was not one of
his companions but who felt he was thinking of his
waiting mother rather than himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>For a little while their progress was indeed very
fair, and as Giraffe counted the number of miles
they were putting behind him he kept smiling more
broadly than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for the busy little worker!&rdquo; he exclaimed
finally. &ldquo;I sure believe it&rsquo;s taken on new life, and
is renewing its youth. And yet they say they can&rsquo;t
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had he spoken the last word when the
engine gave a loud groan that sounded almost
human, and quit working.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s what you get for shouting before
you&rsquo;re out of the woods!&rdquo; said Bumpus, in sheer
disgust.</p>
<p>Giraffe looked blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, do you really believe motors can understand
the English language?&rdquo; he demanded of the
fat scout. &ldquo;This one has been brought up on either
German or French, and how would it know I was
boasting? Anyway next time I say a thing like
that you&rsquo;ll see me knocking on wood right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad was already out and had the hood lifted so
that he could look the disheartened engine over, and
find just what the trouble might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe it&rsquo;s that silly old gas tank again?&rdquo; suggested
Bumpus.</p>
<p>Allan made a hurried examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing wrong here,&rdquo; he announced; &ldquo;no drip,
and plenty of stuff inside. Looks as if the engine
could only stand just so much, and then had a
fainting fit. And no matter where we bring up in
the end, mark my words, fellows, we&rsquo;ve got to work
our passage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Find out what bust, Thad?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, as
he jumped from the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to get it yet, and as there&rsquo;s no
telling what may come along the road while we&rsquo;re
loafing here, suppose we all get busy and push the
car to one side, where it isn&rsquo;t apt to block the
passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad&rsquo;s advice was immediately carried out, and
when this had been done he applied himself industriously
to the task of first ascertaining what had
happened to the wretched engine, and then to repair
the defect, if it were possible.</p>
<p>Giraffe, always nervous and hard to keep quiet,
meanwhile walked over toward a mound that lay
close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to take a little observation, and see if there&rsquo;s
any sign of those airmen we saw yesterday,&rdquo; he
told the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard something that sounded like firing early
this morning,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;and it may be there has
been more warm work going on. The breeze came
from the wrong quarter to help me out, and so I
couldn&rsquo;t be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They saw Giraffe make his way up the little rise
and reach the top, where he began to cup his hands
about his eyes so as to see the better. Possibly
three minutes passed when those at the car heard
sharp barking as of a fox, and which of course was
the call of the Silver Fox Patrol.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s waving to us to come up there!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bumpus, scrambling out of the car, for he had felt
so very comfortable that so far he had not thought
fit to make any change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he means the whole bunch of us in the
bargain, if signals stand for anything, Thad,&rdquo; added
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; the patrol leader replied, as
he started toward the knoll, still gripping the monkey-wrench
with which he had been working at the
time.</p>
<p>With Bumpus puffing at their heels the two boys
soon arrived at the base of the mound, and started
up. It was a severe task for the fat scout, but
Bumpus could do considerable, once he made up
his mind, and he was with them when they reached
the spot where the excited Giraffe stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, Giraffe?&rdquo; asked Allan.</p>
<p>For answer the elongated scout leveled his arm,
and pointed in a certain direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that tall, bushy tree, Thad?&rdquo; he exclaimed;
&ldquo;well, turn your eyes up toward the top of the
same and you&rsquo;ll see what gave me a body blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it!&rdquo; called out Bumpus, &ldquo;and say, it looks
like a man fastened up there! Oh! as sure as anything
it moved then! It must be alive, fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a man,&rdquo; said Thad, decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what on earth could he be doing away up
there?&rdquo; asked Allan, still straining his eyes to look.</p>
<p>Giraffe had a remarkable vision. He could often
discern things that were next to invisible to his
chums.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s caught fast there, I tell you,&rdquo; he remarked,
eagerly, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a good thing for him he is, because
if he fell to the ground he&rsquo;d be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How queer!&rdquo; cried Bumpus, his eyes almost
starting out of their sockets with the intensity of
the interest he took in the affair; &ldquo;whoever could
have hung the poor fellow away up there in that
tree top?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe snorted in disdain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody hung him there, silly!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;He fell there, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fell there!&rdquo; repeated Bumpus, incredulously.
&ldquo;Oh! now you&rsquo;re trying to kid me, Giraffe. I don&rsquo;t
take any stock in those big yarns about Mars being
inhabited, and all that stuff. Speak plainer, can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you look close, Thad,&rdquo; Giraffe said, ignoring
Bumpus completely now, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll see something lying
on the ground near the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right, Giraffe, I see it,&rdquo; replied the
other; &ldquo;and it looks as if it might be some sort of
wreck, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what she is!&rdquo; cried Giraffe exultantly; &ldquo;the
wreck of an aeroplane. That man in the tree must
have been one of the flying squad, German or Belgian,
we don&rsquo;t know which yet. He met with an
accident while up aloft. Mebbe some of that shrapnel
injured his machine, and he was making for the
earth to land far away from the battle field when
he struck that tree, and there he&rsquo;s stuck ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! how hard it must have been for him, hanging
up there all night, and p&rsquo;raps badly hurt at
that!&rdquo; cried the tender-hearted Bumpus. &ldquo;Thad,
you wouldn&rsquo;t think of going on and leaving him
there, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should say not, Bumpus,&rdquo; Giraffe told
him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d deserve to be kicked out of the organization
if ever we did that. How could we look
back without turning fiery red every time we remembered
such a cowardly act? Leave it to us, and
we&rsquo;ll get him down out of that, eh, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our duty compels us to do everything we can to
alleviate distress,&rdquo; the patrol leader said, soberly.
&ldquo;And it doesn&rsquo;t matter the least bit to us whether
that poor chap is a German, Belgian or Frenchman.
He&rsquo;s in a terrible position, and may lose his life
unless we do something for him. So let&rsquo;s head
that way on the run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the car, Thad?&rdquo; asked Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang the car,&rdquo; replied the other, impulsively.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stalled right now, and the engine partly dismantled,
so there&rsquo;s no danger of its running away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; Bumpus was heard to mutter, dubiously,
&ldquo;but cars are mighty funny contraptions any
way you put it, and nobody ever knows what they&rsquo;re
meaning to do. When you think they&rsquo;re sleeping as
sweet as anything they may kick you all of a sudden
just like a mule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus did not say anything more. He needed
all the breath he could gather in so as to keep within
reasonable distance of his three chums, who were
making pretty fast time toward the tall tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>As they drew closer to the spot all doubt concerning
the nature of the heap on the ground was
dissipated. It was undoubtedly a wrecked aeroplane,
and Thad, who had taken pains to look these
things up, told the others it was without question
a Taube model, small but swift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means the man up yonder will turn out to
be a German aviator, doesn&rsquo;t it, Thad?&rdquo; asked Allan,
who was at his side, with Giraffe leading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No question about that,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;because
the Germans are the only ones who are using
the Taube model exclusively. They seem to think
it about fills the bill for safety and speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had seen the man who was held fast among
the branches of the tree almost at the apex, in fact,
wave his hand to them several times. This told
the boys he was still alive, even though possibly
suffering tortures. It also informed them that he
had been watching their coming, and while restraining
from shouting out, meant to implore their
assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we going to get him down?&rdquo; asked
Giraffe, as they reached the foot of the tree, which
looked as though it could be easily scaled, since the
lower limbs came close to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of us must climb up,&rdquo; said Thad. &ldquo;We
can help each other, and it strikes me we ought to
be able to make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing in our favor,&rdquo; remarked Allan, who
was famous for seeing things, &ldquo;the aviator is a
rather small man. That&rsquo;s going to be lots of help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do, Thad?&rdquo; asked Bumpus, willing
to attempt anything going, though his bulk would
hardly allow him to be useful up aloft; in fact he
was apt to bother the others rather than prove of
assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay down here, and take the man when we
lower him from the limbs,&rdquo; Thad told him.</p>
<p>It was not much, Bumpus thought, but then he
could at least say that he had had a hand in the
rescue of the unfortunate aeroplane pilot.</p>
<p>Giraffe climbed quickly, and reached the vicinity
of the stranded aviator first. He was even talking
in German with him when the other two arrived.
They could see just how the garments of the man
had become caught in the branches, so that he was
held there as in a vise, utterly unable to help himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he&rsquo;s been here all night,&rdquo; said Giraffe,
eagerly, his face aglow with pride over the fact that
once more his high school German was proving
valuable. &ldquo;He was swinging up pretty high, taking
notes of the disposition of the Belgian forces, when
he found himself a target for heavy firing. He
thinks his machine must have been hit as well as
himself, for it started to act queer. So he made
off like the wind to get as far away from the firing
line as he could, always falling, and in the end he
struck this tree just before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been wounded in the left arm,&rdquo; said Thad,
&ldquo;for you can see how it hangs helpless, and there&rsquo;s
dried blood on his sleeve too, caking it hard. He
might have bled to death here if that arm didn&rsquo;t
happen to be above him, which has helped to stop
the flow. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;ll start in again while we&rsquo;re
getting him down, but that can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix that soon enough, Thad,&rdquo; said Giraffe,
eagerly, &ldquo;once we get him on the ground. Scouts
ought to know their business enough to fix up any
ordinary hurt like that. But have you arranged
your plan, Thad? Tell us what to do, and you&rsquo;ll
see us get busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The patrol leader had taken a hasty survey of the
situation. He saw there was only one way in which
they could get the aviator free from the clinging
branches, and swing him in to the body of the tree.</p>
<p>Accordingly he began to give his orders clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You reach him on that side, Giraffe, and I&rsquo;ll
take hold here. When we swing him in, Allan, you
catch hold, and keep him steady. Then we&rsquo;ll cut
these twigs, and free his leather coat. But be careful,
both of you, for a slip would mean broken
bones, if not something worse. Now, ready,
Giraffe? Then when I say three, start swinging!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="small">GOOD SAMARITANS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, Allan!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe as the
third boy successfully clutched the aviator, after
they had managed between them to swing him in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Thad now gave instructions just how to work
the branches free, one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep a good hold on him everybody,&rdquo; he said,
and was also pleased to note that the aeroplane pilot
had himself taken a desperate clutch upon a small
limb, as though meaning to be of what little assistance
he could.</p>
<p>Step by step they accomplished it, and before long
were commencing to descend the tree. The man
proved to be full of grit, as was to be expected of
one who continually took his life in his hands in
making those daring aerial flights, thousands of feet
above the earth, and over hostile lines at that, where
he would be a target for dozens of exploding shrapnel
bombs.</p>
<p>Bumpus down below grew more and more excited
the closer they came. He had braced himself
like a gladiator, as though he meant to try
and catch the man if by any mischance he slipped
from their grasp and fell, and Bumpus would have
been foolish enough to offer himself as a buffer, had
any such accident happened.</p>
<p>But there was, fortunately, no slip, and presently
they lowered the man into his waiting arms, so
that after all Bumpus was able to do a small share
in the rescue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Apparently the poor fellow was greatly weakened
by his recent terrible experience. To hang there
the livelong night, swaying with the branches, and in
constant danger of dropping to his death, must have
been a severe shock to his nervous system. And
then besides he had lost much blood, and that would
weaken him in itself, even without the lingering
peril.</p>
<p>He sank to the ground, but at the same time
looked inquiringly at them, as though to question
whether they were capable of helping him further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him, Giraffe, if you can,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;that
as Boy Scouts, over in America, we have learned
how to care for all ordinary wounds, and that we
mean to do what is possible for his arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky, Thad,&rdquo; said Bumpus, &ldquo;that you always
insisted on carrying that little roll of linen
along with you, and some healing salve. I own up
there have been times when I thought you were
foolish to load yourself down that way, but I see
how valuable it can come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people think it folly to insure their
houses,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;but when the fire comes along
they understand what a comfort it is to those who
get the cash to rebuild. I carry this stuff because
one of us might get hurt when away from a doctor
or surgeon. And I&rsquo;m willing to use it on the first
fellow we&rsquo;ve run across who needs it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Giraffe was again talking with the
pilot. The man nodded his head eagerly when he
heard what the tall boy said. Perhaps he knew
what German Boy Scouts were always taught to do
in emergencies, but was in doubt with regard to
their American cousins, for Giraffe had of course
informed him before then how they came from over
the sea, and were only pilgrims in Belgium at the
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>It was deemed advisable to help the man down to
the little stream that Thad had noticed close by.
Here they commenced to get his leather coat off.
It was no easy task, and Bumpus turned pale when
he saw what a mess his arm was in, through lack of
attention for so many hours.</p>
<p>Giraffe had been dispatched over to the car and
returned with a little tin bucket they happened to
possess. Allan meanwhile had started a small fire,
and over this the tin utensil, after being filled with
water, was placed.</p>
<p>When the liquid was heated enough Thad started
to wash the man&rsquo;s arm. Gradually the nature of the
wound was disclosed. After all it was not so very
serious, when that dried blood had been cleansed
from his arm. Some missile from the bursting
shrapnel bomb had cut through the muscles, but it
would soon heal, if no serious consequences followed
his long exposure.</p>
<p>Thad used his liniment and bound the arm up as
carefully as any experienced Red Cross surgeon
could have done under similar conditions. The man
looked very grateful. That could be seen in his
manner, and the pleased way in which he followed
all of Thad&rsquo;s operations with his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Still, there was an expression of doubt on his
face now and then, and Thad could give a pretty
good guess what it meant. Undoubtedly the German
air pilot had begun to wonder just what his
status was going to be, now that he had been
rescued from his perilous position in that high treetop,
and his wound so splendidly dressed. Would
he have to consider himself a prisoner of war?
These boys in khaki who said they came from
America,&mdash;were they so much in sympathy with the
Allies that they would consider it their duty to hand
him over to the Belgians?</p>
<p>He must have put the question to Giraffe when
he talked so fast, for that worthy after having him
repeat it more slowly shook his head, and turning
to Thad remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye think, Thad, the poor chap is wondering
whether he&rsquo;s a prisoner of war or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean he thinks we want to consider him
our prisoner?&rdquo; asked the other. &ldquo;Just let him know
that we&rsquo;re as neutral as we can be, Giraffe. While
we don&rsquo;t like this thing of the big German army
invading the country of the poor Belgians, and think
it all wrong, still we&rsquo;re not taking any side. So far
as we&rsquo;re concerned he is as free as the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Giraffe told this to the eagerly listening
air pilot he seemed to be very much gratified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he has good friends not a great ways
off,&rdquo; reported Giraffe, after some more talk with
the wounded aviator, &ldquo;and thinks he could manage
to reach them, if only he can hide somewhere till
dark settles down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; Thad declared, &ldquo;and so far
as we&rsquo;re concerned we hope he may sooner or later
manage to get back inside the German lines. He&rsquo;s
a brave man, and we&rsquo;re only too glad to have been
of service to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad,&rdquo; continues Giraffe, &ldquo;he says he wants to
write something down if you&rsquo;ve got a pencil and
paper handy. I think he means to fix it so that in
case we run across some of his people they&rsquo;ll be
good to us. It&rsquo;s the only way he knows to show
how grateful he feels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but what it might be a good idea,
although we hope we won&rsquo;t come across any of
those German raiders,&rdquo; Thad remarked, as he
searched his pockets, and found the needed articles.</p>
<p>The man wrote with some difficulty, for his hand
was stiff, but after he had completed his task Giraffe
said he could read it all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone and told how he happened to land in
a tree top, and would have died there only for us
getting him down,&rdquo; explained Giraffe; &ldquo;and then
he goes on to tell how we bound up his wounds, and
did everything for him we could; so that he asks
any German officer who reads this to be kind to us
for his sake. I reckon now that the name he&rsquo;s
signed is well known among German airmen; seems
to me I&rsquo;ve heard it, or seen it in print.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The air pilot had gotten out his pipe, and was
actually enjoying a smoke. Doubtless, being addicted
to the weed he would have suffered less during
the long night could he have had the satisfaction
of an occasional puff.</p>
<p>Allan looked at him curiously, while Giraffe was
filled with admiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;These air pilots have to be pretty cool customers,
it strikes me,&rdquo; he remarked, as they prepared
to say good-bye to the man, who evidently
did not think it wise on his part to go near the
road, lest he be seen and taken prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly do,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;because there
isn&rsquo;t a second when they&rsquo;re up in the air that they&rsquo;re
not in deadly danger. A man may stumble on
land; he may have an accident when on the water,
but he&rsquo;s got a fair chance to save himself. With
them a collapse means being snuffed out of existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! excuse me from being an aviator!&rdquo; declared
Bumpus, so fervently that Giraffe turned and
looked him over from head to foot, to remark
caustically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of that happening, Bumpus. They&rsquo;d
have to build a Zeppelin to accommodate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m not thinking seriously of trying it,
Giraffe,&rdquo; said the other, sweetly. &ldquo;I guess I know
my shortcomings as well as any one could. I don&rsquo;t
expect to fly as long as I stay in this world. There
may be a time&mdash;but never mind about that. Our
friend wants to shake hands with you, Thad. He
knows what a heap you&rsquo;ve done for him, and I
guess he&rsquo;ll have a right good opinion of American
Boy Scouts after this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>The rescued German aviator shook hands not only
with Thad but each one of them in turn, and he
said something in his own language which Giraffe
later on told them was a warm expression of his
heartfelt gratitude.</p>
<p>As the four lads started toward the road where
they had left the stranded car he was standing there
and waving his uninjured hand after them. When,
however, they arrived at the mound and looked
back once more he had disappeared.</p>
<p>Some people were coming along the road, and
possibly the man may have discovered them before
the boys did, seeking a place of refuge in order
that they might not make out that he was a German,
and so carry the news to some Belgian regiment
quartered nearby.</p>
<p>Thad started in to work at the engine as though
this thing of being called off to save the life of a
birdman was a mere nothing at all, just coming
along in the course of his ordinary business.</p>
<p>Bumpus installed himself in his seat and watched
him work. That was a favorite occupation with
Bumpus, for he did enjoy seeing some one else do
things about as well as any boy that ever lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think he&rsquo;ll get clear of his enemies, Thad?&rdquo; he
remarked, showing that all the while his thoughts
were connected with the air pilot whom they had
just rescued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed to feel pretty sure of it,&rdquo; the other
replied, &ldquo;though of course he&rsquo;d have to avoid all
the people living around this section, for they&rsquo;d
turn on him if they guessed he was a German. The
Belgians are pretty furious over their country being
overrun with the Kaiser&rsquo;s troops. I&rsquo;ve even seen old
peasants handling guns as if they meant to fight
for their homes, a very foolish thing for them to
do, because it would only enrage the invaders, and
end with a massacre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You act as if you&rsquo;d remedied the break in the
engine, Thad, seeing that you&rsquo;re putting up your
tools, and wiping your hands off,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it fixed,&rdquo; Thad informed him, without
any great show of enthusiasm; &ldquo;but remember I&rsquo;m
not promising how long it&rsquo;s going to stand. There&rsquo;s
always a toss-up with a machine of this kind as to
what part will break down next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about that, will you?&rdquo; growled Giraffe,
in disgust. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to kick the old box into the
river only that it does save us some walking. It&rsquo;s
a lottery any way you can fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get aboard everybody, and let&rsquo;s see how she
cranks,&rdquo; suggested Thad.</p>
<p>As usual it took several urgent efforts before the
engine decided to heed the call to duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, she sings like a bird!&rdquo; cried Bumpus as
the loud whirr announced that once again their
motor was in working order.</p>
<p>So they started off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing sure,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, looking back
toward the place where presently they could just
glimpse the top of the tall tree where they had
found such queer fruit growing, &ldquo;that was a remarkable
little adventure, and none of us are likely
to forget it in a hurry either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know for one I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; declared Bumpus; &ldquo;and
every time I look at this bolt that I took from the
broken Taube aeroplane I&rsquo;ll think of how you fellows
climbed right up to the top of that tree and
brought the birdman down safe to the ground, and
how I stood there to receive him. Yes, it&rsquo;s marked
with a white stone in my memory, and I can just
imagine how Smithy, Step Hen, Davy Jones and
Bob White&rsquo;ll stare when they hear the story of the
wrecked aeroplane man!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">THE BATTLE AT THE BRIDGE.</span></h2>
<p>Once more the fugitives managed to go on for
some little distance, with nothing out of the common
run happening. Bumpus was thinking that
the engine had commenced to act quite decently,
but of course he did not dare mention this fact
aloud. The recollection of what had followed when
Giraffe boasted was still fresh in his memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fork in the road ahead of us, Thad,&rdquo;
announced the keen-eyed Giraffe. &ldquo;Do we take the
right or the left branch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little dubious about that,&rdquo; said the pilot
at the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what does your chart say?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As near as I can make out,&rdquo; he was told, &ldquo;the
roads come together again some ways further on,
perhaps as much as seven miles or so. The one
that leads toward the left seems to be shorter than
the other by considerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why should you hesitate about starting
along that one?&rdquo; asked Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because it heads so far toward the southwest,
you see,&rdquo; explained Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m on now,&rdquo; exclaimed the tall scout.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit worried for fear we&rsquo;ll run smack into
some of the fighting that seems to have been going
on over that way&mdash;is that it, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, Giraffe, but on the whole I think
I&rsquo;ll make the try. If we see things getting thick
ahead of us we can turn around and come back
again at the worst. And if we do manage to get
along without being held up we&rsquo;ll save quite some
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was how they came to be moving along that
road, and heading in a direction that opened up new
hazards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to keep a good lookout whenever we
strike a rise,&rdquo; the pilot warned them. &ldquo;Tell me if
you happen to see anything that looks suspicious,
for it may be a hard job to get turned around, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each one of the others readily promised, though
very likely the task would fall principally to Giraffe,
as he had the best eyes for this purpose.</p>
<p>They may have covered as much as three miles
after passing the fork when they saw a hill ahead
of them. Bumpus looked and groaned. He knew
what that meant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;More push coming, fellows!&rdquo; commented
Giraffe. &ldquo;As for me, I won&rsquo;t be sorry to get out
and stretch my legs a bit, because they&rsquo;re feeling
cramped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit it up for all the old tub can carry, Thad,&rdquo;
begged Bumpus. &ldquo;The further she carries us before
giving up the ghost the less hard work we&rsquo;ll
have to do. Go it, you shirker, do your level best!
If you could only drag us all the way up I&rsquo;d beg
your pardon for ever having even thought evil of
you. Here we go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started up the rise bravely enough, but
speedily the engine began to make signs as of distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready to jump, everybody!&rdquo; called out
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s easy for you to say,&rdquo; complained
poor Bumpus, &ldquo;but think of me, won&rsquo;t you? How
can I spring like a frog when she starts to go backward
down the hill again? I&rsquo;ll do my best to roll
out; only somebody grab hold, and don&rsquo;t let me get
started rolling like a barrel after the car!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no danger,&rdquo; Thad told them. &ldquo;Just as soon
as she stops I&rsquo;ll jam on the brake and let her back off
the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re two-thirds of the way to the top anyhow!&rdquo;
cried Giraffe, triumphantly.</p>
<p>He had hardly spoken when the engine gave a
last expiring puff, and Thad immediately turned the
car into the little ditch alongside the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>They had done this grand pushing act so often
by this time that they had it all reduced to a system.
Two took hold on either side, and in this way the
car was urged up the balance of the rise. With
but a couple of stops, so as to catch their breath,
the boys managed to reach the crown of the low
hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worth all it took to get here, just to enjoy that
grand view!&rdquo; gasped Allan.</p>
<p>Giraffe uttered a cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look down there to where the road crosses a
river by a bridge!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there are lots of men in uniforms on the
other side of the bridge, Belgian soldiers as sure as
anything!&rdquo; cried Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got cannon, too,&rdquo; added Bumpus, staring
with distended eyes, &ldquo;because you c&rsquo;n see the
glint in the sunlight. What d&rsquo;ye suppose it all
means, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As usual he had to appeal to the patrol leader
for an opinion. Bumpus had never fully learned
that a scout should try to figure out things for
himself, and not be forever asking some one else
for an explanation. But then it was so much
easier doing things by proxy, and Bumpus, as every
one knew, hated to exert himself more than was
absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bridge must be an important one, I should
say,&rdquo; Thad explained, &ldquo;and the battery has had
orders to guard it so that no German cavalrymen
can cross.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps sooner or later there will be a
fierce old fight take place right down there!&rdquo; Giraffe
was saying, half to himself, and with a touch of
envy in his voice, as though he felt sorry that he
could not be upon that same hill so as to watch the
battle below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought we to keep on and try to get across that
bridge, Thad?&rdquo; asked Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question whether the Belgians would let
us get close enough to tell who we are. They
might open on us as soon as we came in sight,&rdquo;
Bumpus remarked, from which it might easily be
seen what he hoped Thad would do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to have the chance to try and
cross the bridge,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, &ldquo;and if you
want to know the reason why just look along the
river road that joins this one down near the
bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had the others done this than loud
and excited exclamations told what a shock they
had received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what all the dust meant I noticed rising
over those trees,&rdquo; said Bumpus. &ldquo;Why, there comes
a whole army of soldiers, and say, they&rsquo;ve got field
guns along with them, too, because you can see the
horses dragging the same.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And do you notice the gray uniforms they are
wearing?&rdquo; Giraffe demanded. &ldquo;That shows who
they are&mdash;the Kaiser&rsquo;s men, as sure as anything.
Now there&rsquo;s going to be the dickens to pay. The
river must be deep, and I reckon that same bridge
is the only one around this section. The Germans
are bent on crossing over, and the Belgians just as
set that they shan&rsquo;t do the same. Thad, you won&rsquo;t
think of quitting this splendid view-place and losing
the one chance we may ever have to see a real
up-to-date battle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad did not answer immediately. He had a
boy&rsquo;s curiosity as well as Giraffe, and felt that it
would be something to say they had actually witnessed
a fierce fight between the rivals for Belgian
soil, the defenders and the invaders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we will stay a while,&rdquo; he finally said; &ldquo;but
first let&rsquo;s get the car turned around, and make
sure it will work when called on. We may have
to leave here in a big hurry, you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These little matters having been duly attended
to they were in a position to observe all that was
transpiring below. It was just like a grand panorama,
or something that had been staged for a
moving picture show.</p>
<p>The German battery was advancing on a gallop
now, as though the fact had been discovered that
the bridge was guarded by the Belgians. Men could
be seen using the whip on the steaming horses, already
galloping wildly. The rumble of the wheels
on the road came distinctly to the ears of the interested
boys standing on the rise, and really not
more than a mile or so from the scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, the troops are coming on the double-quick,
too!&rdquo; announced Giraffe. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see the
end of them yet, and I should think there must be
thousands of soldiers in that bunch. It&rsquo;s going to
be a hot old affair, believe me. Mebbe the Germans
may carry the bridge, and again they might get
more than they bargained for right there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidences of considerable excitement could be
seen among the defenders of the river bridge. Men
ran this way and that; perhaps ammunition was being
placed handy, so that the guns could be quickly
served, because time was a factor that would undoubtedly
enter into the result. A delay of a few
seconds was apt to count heavily for either side
when fighting it out at such close quarters.</p>
<p>Of course all of the scouts were keenly interested.
While neither Thad nor Allan felt just the same
eagerness that Giraffe displayed, at the same time
they knew such an opportunity to see a wonderful
and terrible spectacle would not be apt to come
their way again in a hurry, and so they were satisfied
to stay.</p>
<p>As for Bumpus, he was shivering, not with eagerness,
but in anticipation of awful sights he expected
to witness, once those guns started business.
The florid look had left his round face, and it was
now almost pallid, with his blue eyes round and
expectant.</p>
<p>Amidst clouds of dust and more or less racket the
German battery came dashing along. It broke
through into a field as though all this had been
figured out beforehand in the wonderful systematic
way these Teuton fighters did nearly everything
they undertook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>There the horses were detached from the guns
and caissons and hurried away to a place of security.
Already a loud crash announced that the Belgians
were beginning hostilities, not meaning to wait until
that host of grim gray-clad infantry reached the
abutment of the bridge.</p>
<p>The four boys watched and saw a shell burst close
to one of the German batteries. It did not seem
to do any damage, nor did the gunners show the
least sign of any flinching, but went steadily about
their work of loading.</p>
<p>Other shots began to roar out until there was a
constant crash in the air almost deafening, and
white powder smoke rose in billows, through which
the watchers on the hilltop could actually discover
flashes of flame when another gun was discharged.</p>
<p>The battle for the bridge was now on in earnest.
Hurrying figures could be seen in every direction.
The Germans were evidently not fully satisfied with
their first position for down came the horses again,
and being attached to the guns the latter were
whisked further up the rise where they could get a
better chance to shell the chosen position of the
Belgian battery.</p>
<p>It seemed to get more and more exciting every
second. None of the boys said a single word; they
were too intensely interested in looking; and besides,
the riot of noise was now at its height, so
that they would have had to shout in order to have
made themselves heard, even close at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Doubtless there had already been many casualties
on both sides, with all that furious bombardment
at close range; but the smoke hid much of this from
the eyes of the spectators. Thad was of the opinion
the Germans could not have known of the Belgian
battery at the bridge; he believed that had they been
aware of it in all probability their battery would
have taken up its stand on the crown of the hill
where the four scouts stood, from which point they
could have made it too warm for the Belgians to
remain there below.</p>
<p>All at once Thad realized that the infantry columns
had been hurrying along the road and scattering
through the fields near by. He caught glimpses
of their number and was amazed when he saw they
must be in the thousands. Other batteries also
began to show up back along the road. This was
not a sporadic dash on the part of a mere detachment
of the German force, but an advance of the
main army, bent on getting around the stumbling
block at Li&eacute;ge.</p>
<p>And to himself Thad was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They mean to take that bridge, no matter how
many lives it costs them, for it is an important link
in their general plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe was calling out something. It chanced
that there was a little lull in the roar of guns, and
they could hear what he was saying.</p>
<p>It seemed to give the finishing thrill to the situation,
as though the grand climax had been reached.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Oh, see what they&rsquo;re meaning to do, fellows!&rdquo;
was what Giraffe cried at the top of his
shrill voice. &ldquo;The order&rsquo;s been given to charge the
bridge, and as sure as you live there they go with
a rush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Bumpus hurriedly put his hands before his
eyes, though possibly peeping through between his
fingers, impelled by some dreadful fascination.</p>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">VICTORY IN DEFEAT.</span></h2>
<p>Through the clouds of powder smoke they could
see that the Germans were moving toward the
bridge in solid ranks, shoulder to shoulder, in the
favorite formation of the Kaiser&rsquo;s troops, and one
which gives them confidence to march straight into
the jaws of certain death.</p>
<p>Other detached groups were hastening down to
the bank of the river, apparently with the idea of
swimming across in some fashion, so as to gather on
the opposite shore, and take the hostile battery in
the rear.</p>
<p>It was all wonderfully exciting, and no boy could
stand there gazing at such a stirring spectacle himself
unmoved. So many things were happening all
the time that as Giraffe afterwards said, it was like
&ldquo;trying to see a three-ringed circus, where amazing
feats were being enacted in all three rings at the
same time.&rdquo; A fellow would have need of several
pairs of eyes if he expected to lose nothing of all
that went on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>As the head of the attacking column drew nearer
the bridge the Belgian gunners stopped firing at the
battery above. They turned their guns directly at
the close ranks of the oncoming host.</p>
<p>When Thad actually saw a shell explode in the
midst of that pack of gray-garbed men, and noted
the terrible gap that followed he felt sick for the
moment. He was, however, unable to tear his eyes
away from the sight; it was so novel, so fascinating,
and so dreadful that it held his gaze as the
pole does the needle of a compass.</p>
<p>There was not the slightest sign of a stop, even
though other shells tore ugly gaps through the lines.
To Thad it almost seemed as though those men
were parts of a vast machine which, having been
set in motion, could not be stayed.</p>
<p>One thing he noticed, and this was that the Belgian
battery was entirely unsupported. If ever the
Germans managed to push across the bridge they
would easily smother the few gallant defenders of
the highway to Brussels.</p>
<p>From this Thad judged that the few Belgians at
the bridge must have their plans all arranged, and
that when they found their cause hopeless there
would be a sudden change of front. Perhaps they
would bring the horses forward, and try to save
their field-pieces from capture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Now some of those who had hurried to the edge
of the water were wading in, holding their guns
high above their heads. Others ran up and down
the bank looking for any kind of old boat that
could be utilized in order to transport a few at a
time across to the other side.</p>
<p>There were still a considerable number who hastened
along the bank toward the abutment of the
bridge. The intention of these latter could not well
be mistaken, for they meant to gain access to the
structure, regardless of the success or failure of the
general assault.</p>
<p>Suddenly in the midst of all this clamor a shadow
fell athwart the four scouts standing on that rise,
and staring downward. Looking up they discovered
an aeroplane, low down, and speeding swiftly
toward the spot where that desperate fight for the
possession of the bridge was taking place.</p>
<p>Thad instantly recognized another of those Taube
machines, so different in construction from all others
that, once noticed, they could never again be
mistaken. Then it was a German aviator who
served as pilot aboard that little buzzing craft. He
should have covered the field before the soldiers
came, and his report might have made a difference
in the attack.</p>
<p>As it was now he headed straight for the half-concealed
Belgian battery, as though it might be
the intention of the man aloft to drop bombs on the
gunners, and help to create a panic among them.</p>
<p>Somehow the boys found themselves compelled to
follow the flight of the birdman as he swooped down
and crossed the river. Whether there was a bridge
or not made no difference to him. He was as free
to come and go as the swallow that on swift wing
flashes past the house chimney of a summer evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Looking intently Thad could even see when he
raised his arm, and he knew the precise instant the
bomb had been thrown. Allowing his eyes to drop
to the ground he saw a sudden burst of smoke and
realized that that was where the deadly little missile
had burst.</p>
<p>Still swinging around in a circle the birdman
commenced hurling other menacing missiles. Each
time the result could be seen in the puff of smoke
close to the Belgian battery; but at that distance it
was impossible for Thad to make sure that any
casualty followed those repeated thrusts.</p>
<p>But now the head of the attacking German force
had reached the bridge. Fearful had been the
price they paid for this advantage; but fresh men
had closed up the gaps, so that they were just as
densely packed as ever when they came to the end
of the structure.</p>
<p>A gun had been so placed that it commanded the
length of the bridge. When it was fired there followed
a shrinking of the whole front of the attacking
force, as if it had been terribly smitten. That
was just for a second, and then the red lane was
closed by the gray flood, and the first hostile feet
were set upon the bridge.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the crisis was now at hand. Thad
fairly held his breath with anticipation with what
was to come though he could not even give so much
as a guess as to its nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Surely those valiant Belgians must have prepared
against such an eventuality as this, and would not
be caught napping. There was no force in hiding
that Thad was able to discover, ready to burst into
view, and grapple with the oncoming Germans after
they had gotten fully upon the bridge.</p>
<p>Ah! from above he saw the horses dashing madly
to the spot! Then the Belgians meant to withdraw
while there was still time. But it seemed incredible
to Thad that they should leave the bridge intact in
the hands of the invaders.</p>
<p>He quickly understood when, without the slightest
warning, there came a mighty shock that made the
very earth quiver, and the further end of the bridge
was seen to vanish into space, accompanied with a
rising cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>They had blown up the bridge when realizing the
futility of further resistance against the superior
numbers of the Germans.</p>
<p>When the great cloud of smoke had cleared away
sufficiently for the scouts to again see what was
going on they found that the horses had been attached
to such of the Belgian guns as were in condition,
and already the foremost was moving along
the road leading directly away from the ruined
bridge.</p>
<p>A few of the soldiers who had crossed the river
tried to take pot shots at the gunners who lay as
flat as they possibly could while riding the horses,
or holding on to the caissons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>The battle was over, and, looking down at the
ruins of the bridge, Thad was of the opinion that
it had ended in favor of the defenders. True they
had been obliged to sacrifice the bridge in the end,
but that mattered little since they had balked the
design of the invaders to seize and use the crossing
of the river. Now much time must be wasted in
building another bridge, or else in seeking a new
way for crossing the river with their guns.</p>
<p>As the smoke lifted further the boys could see
what was going on. Many must have been injured
when the bridge was blown up, for there was
great scurrying to and fro, with men bearing
stretchers in evidence.</p>
<p>Bumpus had allowed his hands to fall from his
eyes now, though he could be seen shaking his head
after a sad fashion. Plainly Bumpus was stirred to
the depths of his heart by the conviction that there
must be scores of those who were terribly wounded
down there, and who needed attention the worst
kind.</p>
<p>Had Thad only given the word that would have
taken them to the aid of the suffering Germans
Bumpus would have gladly responded, even though
his knowledge of surgery was confined to the first
elements of binding up a wound.</p>
<p>But Thad did not mean to attempt such a thing.
He knew that soldiers would never permit inexperienced
boys like they were to play the part of
army hospital attendants. They were amply supplied
with all the necessary means for saving life;
and besides, soldiers are taught never to grumble
no matter how long they have to wait after being
shot down on the battlefield, before their chance
comes for attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Those who had actually stemmed the current of
the river only to find that their intended prey had
escaped them were seen rushing about on the other
bank. They may have been looking for wounded
Belgians to make prisoners; Thad hoped it was not
any desire to kill that animated them in the bitter
hour of defeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! is there no end to the procession?&rdquo; exclaimed
Giraffe, as he could still see countless numbers
of the same gray-coated soldiers swarming out
of the woods to the west, and coming on in serried
ranks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to think of the nerve of that one little
battery trying to hold a whole army corps in check!&rdquo;
declared Allen. &ldquo;It strikes me these Belgians are
the bravest of the brave, and mean to fight for their
country to the last gasp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I believe?&rdquo; demanded
Giraffe, as though a sudden thought had come into
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us, please, Giraffe,&rdquo; asked Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if that battery we
watched do all this fighting was the identical one I
saw come into that town. You remember I told you
about the chat I had with a young gunner who
could talk United States? I hope now he isn&rsquo;t one
of those who are lying across the river, where the
German shells and bullets caught them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>He glanced almost pityingly toward the place
where the battery had been stationed, as though
he had a personal interest in the gallant Belgian
gunner. Thad was meanwhile watching the movements
of those on the near side of the river. He
could see how machine-like everything was carried
on, the men with the stretchers coming to get
their burdens, and then carrying them to the rear,
where a temporary field hospital would undoubtedly
be started.</p>
<p>Already a corps of engineers had come up, and
men were seen out on the broken bridge, measuring
the gap as though figuring on what would be required
to mend the causeway so that the heavy artillery
could move across, converging toward
Brussels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get across, all right, you can see,&rdquo; asserted
Allan, drawing a long breath, as though up
to then he had been too fascinated to do more than
gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the Belgians detained them,&rdquo; urged
Giraffe, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s their game, we understand.
Every hour that the Kaiser can be held in Belgium
is life for France, because it gives time to get her
men together. Germany is the only country that
has always been ready for such a thing as this.
They expected to be in Paris before the French
woke up, and only for this delay nothing could have
prevented them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you wait till the Britishers get over, and
going good,&rdquo; said Bumpus, with a wise nod of his
head, &ldquo;then you&rsquo;ll hear something drop.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; jeered Giraffe, who was anti-British when
he chose, and this was whenever he thought he could
get up an argument with Bumpus, &ldquo;John Bull will
make a pretty loud crack when he falls, I should
imagine. He&rsquo;ll find that these Germans are a whole
lot different from the Boers or the Kaffirs, or the
Arab slavers of Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; said Bumpus, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to the
conclusion that bravery isn&rsquo;t monopolized by any
one nation on earth. Look at the Belgians for instance;
could you beat the way they held that bridge
till the last gasp and then blew the whole business
sky-high with dynamite, and some Germans with
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad had listened to what they were saying. He
knew that it was no time for argument, for how
could they tell but what some of those Germans
might come up the hill to see what sort of road it
was, or else get a good view for miles around, and
they would not want to be caught there. Explanations
might prove awkward, if the invaders chose
to believe they had been giving the range by signal
to the defenders of the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s be getting away from here, boys,&rdquo;
said Thad.</p>
<p>There was not a single objection, and rather white
of face, as well as awed, the four scouts moved over
to where the car stood awaiting them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>A short time afterward they commenced to coast
down the hill which only a little while back had
been climbed with such painful penalties. And now
that it was all over not one of them was sorry
because of what he had witnessed that August
morning.</p>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">THE CALL FOR HELP.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Giraffe, would you mind bending over and
pinching me?&rdquo; asked Bumpus, sweetly, after they
had been going on for a short time, leaving the
watch-hill behind them, with all its dreadful memories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I will, Bumpus, as many times as you want
me to. I&rsquo;m the most accommodating fellow you
ever knew, and I can give a nip equal to one of
those dobsons we use for catching black bass in the
good old summer time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe evidently was as good as his word, for
there was an immediate low screech from the fat
chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Giraffe, that&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; he hastened to
exclaim. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have me all black and blue if you
keep that going. I&rsquo;m sure of it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure of what?&rdquo; asked Allan, chuckling, for this
was not the first time he had seen this interesting
little circus play come off between the two chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;m awake, and didn&rsquo;t just dream about
that awful battle!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Bumpus shuddered as though he had suddenly
been taken with a chill that foretold a visitation of
the ague or malaria. They knew from this that
the sights he had recently witnessed must have
made a tremendous impression on his mind, and
would probably haunt him for many a long day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess all of us feel pretty much the same
way you do, Bumpus,&rdquo; Thad informed him.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry to have seen such sights, and yet glad
at the same time. It was an opportunity that few
American scouts could ever expect to have come
their way. And if we could have done any good
we&rsquo;d have been only too glad of a chance to offer
our services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d have laughed at us if we&rsquo;d risked it,&rdquo;
asserted Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And like as not bundled us all into a dungeon
for suspects,&rdquo; added Giraffe, although he immediately
added, &ldquo;but say, did you ever see such dauntless
bravery as those same Germans showed when
they marched straight up to that bridge, and every
time a hole was torn in their ranks closed in as if on
dress parade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; spoke up Bumpus, &ldquo;it struck
me that handful of Belgians showed the real stuff
in the way of bravery, holding out with ten or
twenty times their number against them. The German
brand of courage seems to be different from
some others I know of. They are parts of a big
machine, and have to touch elbows when they
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe was up in arms at once, but Thad poured
oil on the troubled waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Giraffe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is what Bumpus
means, and I&rsquo;ve read the same thing more than
once; even high German generals have admitted it.
Germans soldiers are not trained to take the initiative
like our men and the French are. They are
educated to obey orders as a unit, and a company
of them will walk directly into the jaws of death
with a courage that couldn&rsquo;t be beaten. But there&rsquo;s
little of that hurrah and dash and single-handed
work we&rsquo;re accustomed to associating with heroic
actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps there was food for thought in what the
scout leader said. Giraffe may not have looked at
matters in this light before. He became pensive
as though revolving the theory over in his mind.
Then he broke the short silence by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the fork of the road, Thad, and we can
make a start in the other direction. After all the
longest way around is sometimes the quickest way
to the fire. But for one I&rsquo;m glad we took the
other. I&rsquo;ve seen a real battle, and that&rsquo;s talking
some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was good reason for Thad to be thoughtful.
Troubles seemed to be multiplying as they
proceeded. He was beginning to believe that young
Belgian gunner with whom Giraffe had talked must
have known what he was saying when he declared
they had but one chance in three to get through
the country that seemed to be a network of war
trails, with hostile forces moving in every direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Secretly Thad was rapidly coming to the conclusion
that they would show their wisdom by turning
back and making for the Dutch border again.
Once in Holland they could take a train for Rotterdam,
and in some way secure a passage to Antwerp.</p>
<p>The more he considered this the better it looked
to him. He was even sorry now he had not insisted
on such a course at the time they were across the
border. In fact he had given up mostly on account
of the plea advanced by Bumpus, who after all was
a poor one to make suggestions.</p>
<p>So Thad determined that should they meet with
another backset, he was bound to put the matter
before his chums in its true light. He knew he
could count on the support of Allan, and also that
Giraffe was open to conviction, even if a little set
in his way.</p>
<p>For a few miles the car moved along the second
road fairly well, though Thad was chagrined to find
that he could not speed it up at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails the old shebang, Thad?&rdquo; demanded
Giraffe, impatiently, when it crawled along with
sundry groanings and complainings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tired out, and creaks in the joints, don&rsquo;t you
know,&rdquo; said Bumpus, with one of his old-time grins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But shucks! we&rsquo;re on level ground right now,
and she ought to spin along like fun!&rdquo; mentioned
Giraffe, with a snort of disgust. &ldquo;Why, honest, I
could keep out of your way walking, and never feel
it. Talk to me about an ice-wagon, this goes it one
better. It&rsquo;s like those harvester engines we see
creeping along the country roads up our way, slow
but sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you figure can be the matter, Thad?&rdquo;
asked Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a fog,&rdquo; came the reply. &ldquo;The only thing
I can think of is that some of that petrol we bought
at double price is mighty poor stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it&rsquo;s been weakened to make it seem
more,&rdquo; said Giraffe. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know oil and water
could be mixed, but mebbe these smart Belgians
have found a way to do it. And Thad, now that
you mention it I reckon you&rsquo;ve about hit the right
nail on the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing to be done,&rdquo; ventured
Allan; &ldquo;so we&rsquo;ll have to grin and bear it. But let&rsquo;s
hope we&rsquo;ll strike a chance before long to buy a new
lot of gas, and this time get a decent quality with
push in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Giraffe, &ldquo;just now it looks as if
we had need of all the push going; in fact I was
going to offer to step out and put my shoulder
against the car to help along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get all that pleasure right away,&rdquo;
Bumpus told him, &ldquo;because I can glimpse another
of those rises ahead there, and we&rsquo;ll never make a
third of it under this low pressure, worse luck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Just as he had prophesied they were compelled
to work their passage to the top of the rise, though
coasting down the other side with a fine burst of
speed. About a mile beyond this point Thad was
noticed to listen attentively, and immediately work
the car over to one side of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something coming!&rdquo; announced Giraffe, &ldquo;and
listen to the row, will you? Makes me think of a
fire engine going on the run. But it&rsquo;s an automobile
at that, believe me. Give &rsquo;em all the room you
can, Thad, because, my word! they&rsquo;re coming to
beat the band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already they could see the dust rising above the
trees, and all sorts of vague speculations took form
in the minds of the boys. Then suddenly there
burst into view a strange contraption, the like of
which none of them had ever seen before.</p>
<p>In one way it was a large car, but it had been
boxed in with some sort of metal, so that it looked
like a &ldquo;battering ram,&rdquo; as Giraffe declared afterwards.</p>
<p>Rushing at a rapid pace along the road it quickly
reached the car and sped past. The staring scouts
heard loud voices, and even saw waving hands over
the top of the barricade. Then it was lost to view
in the cloud of dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! That&rsquo;s going some!&rdquo; gasped Giraffe.</p>
<p>Bumpus was coughing from the dust he had inhaled,
but he managed to give expression to his
astonishment in a few jerky sentences:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! whatever was that! I thought a goods van
had skipped off the railroad track and was raging
along the road. Thad, can you guess it? Please
enlighten me. Schew!&rdquo; and he ended up in a tremendous
sneeze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I know, though I never saw anything
like it before,&rdquo; Thad obligingly told him. &ldquo;I
remember reading that some Belgian had been experimenting
with what he called an armored motor-car,
and which it was claimed would be a terror in
war times. I think that must have been it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; admitted Giraffe, scratching his head,
&ldquo;it was all of that, let me tell you. And Thad, there
was a hole in the armor plating on our side. That
must be where they use the quick-firing gun that
mows things down, just as the farmer cuts the
wheat with his machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that war engine struck a regiment of the
enemy it would make holes in their ranks, all right,&rdquo;
Allan remarked, with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I saw it,&rdquo; ventured Bumpus, &ldquo;but
they&rsquo;re sure a reckless lot aboard, from the way
they rushed along this road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes that sort of men to use an armored car,
I should think,&rdquo; said Thad. &ldquo;They expect to drop
down on the enemy wherever they can find him, and
never stop to count heads, but just run the gantlet,
firing as they go. If they&rsquo;re lucky, and get through
without an accident, they go back home laughing
over a good day&rsquo;s hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This war is bound to show up some queer
freaks,&rdquo; remarked Allan. &ldquo;Now, d&rsquo;ye know that
armored car makes me think of the war chariots the
ancient Romans used, with sharp knives fastened to
the wheels, and as they dashed through the crowded
ranks of the Goths and Vandals these mowed them
down. This scheme is only a little more up to date,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing new under the sun, when you come to
look into things,&rdquo; declared Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This mad pace gives me a shiver,&rdquo; said Giraffe.
&ldquo;As I didn&rsquo;t sleep good last night I think I&rsquo;ll cuddle
down right here, and take a few winks. If anything
exciting comes along just give me a jolt, will you,
Bumpus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than likely to be a hill,&rdquo; was the reassuring
answer returned by the stout chum. &ldquo;All I&rsquo;m
hoping for now is that we strike a village pretty
soon, where we can find some decent petrol for sale,
and load up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! one word for the petrol and two for your
dinner,&rdquo; chuckled Giraffe. &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t say anything
more to me, Bumpus, because I&rsquo;m booked for
a nap. The warm sunshine, the drone of the bees,
the grunting of our elegant car, and a lot of other
things combined make me feel <i>aw</i>-fully drowsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was really meaning it, too, for he had closed
his eyes, and seemed about ready to let his senses
slip away. Bumpus looked down at him as though
he might not object to a little of the same sweet
slumber himself. With Thad and Allan on guard
there could be no harm in giving way to this feeling.
And should they come to one of those nuisances
in the way of rises, which would stall the
engine, of course all of them stood ready to drop
out and do their duty.</p>
<p>But it was not to be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>They happened to be passing a small cottage just
then. It sat back from the road, and there were
flowers in the front yard, yes, and a well also. Thad
was almost tempted to stop and ask for a drink,
but he thought better of it. Further on, when they
came to a town, and made an effort to secure a
supply of petrol it would be time enough to think
of quenching their thirst, aggravated by the dust
they were forced to breathe most of the time.</p>
<p>And it was at that instant they heard wild shrieks
ring out, in a woman&rsquo;s voice. Looking toward
the cottage and half expecting to see it in flames
they discovered a woman at the well. She was
wringing her hands frantically, now leaning over
to peer into the depths, and then rocking to and fro
as if in the very abandon of grief over something.</p>
<p>Thad stopped the car instantly. Both Giraffe and
Bumpus were on their feet, and staring with might
and main at the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! whatever has happened?&rdquo; the latter was
exclaiming in horrified tones. &ldquo;She acts like a
child had fallen down the well!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">UP FROM THE DEPTHS.</span></h2>
<p>That must have been the thought flashing
through the mind of each of the other three scouts.
Indeed, what else could they believe, after seeing
the woman carrying on in such a wild way?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Giraffe made a flying leap out of the car, nor
were the others far behind him. They all ran
toward the cottage, and the kneeling woman, deeply
impressed with the seriousness of the incident.
Their duty as scouts loomed up before them. Unless
it was already too late they must find some way
to save the poor woman&rsquo;s child from a watery
grave.</p>
<p>Giraffe was trying to understand what she was
crying as the others came up, although from the
frown on his face it was evident that he could not
be meeting with any great success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Benjy, boys,&rdquo; the tall scout exclaimed,
&ldquo;and he&rsquo;s down there in the well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! the poor little chap!&rdquo; whimpered Bumpus,
as he watched the others throw themselves flat on
their stomachs, and try to peer into the dark recesses
of the gaping stone-bordered hole in the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Thad, in a thrilling voice. &ldquo;I can
hear splashing down there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; added Giraffe, &ldquo;which shows the
child is alive still. That settles it with me. I&rsquo;m
the one to go down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad had already discovered that there was a
windlass above the well. A stout rope was wound
around the barrel of this, and the bucket could be
seen standing on the other side on a stone shelf intended
for the purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>He knew that whatever was done there should be
no more delay than was absolutely necessary. His
first act therefore was to step around and release
the bucket, at the same time grasping hold of the
handle of the windlass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your feet on the bucket and hold on, Giraffe,&rdquo;
he told the adventurous one. &ldquo;When you get
down close to the water give one call. To lower a
little more give two; and when you&rsquo;re ready to
come up make it three. Understand that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Thad; lower away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus was also peering over the edge into those
mysterious depths. The woman was beside him,
still wringing her hands in nervous anguish, and
repeating that word &ldquo;Benjy&rdquo; until it was so impressed
on the memory of Bumpus that he could
never forget it.</p>
<p>Immediately Giraffe disappeared from view, and
all they could hear consisted of the creaking of the
windlass, as Thad lowered away, and the hysterical
wailing of the woman belonging at the cottage.</p>
<p>A dozen and more times had the handle gone
around and Thad began to wonder how deep that
well could be. Then suddenly he heard a cry. It
welled up from the depths and sounded very weird,
but Thad knew this must be the signal he had arranged
with Giraffe, to indicate that the latter was
close to the water.</p>
<p>Immediately there came two more calls, which
meant that Giraffe wished to be lowered a little
further; Thad accordingly allowed another turn of
the handle, so as to release several more feet of the
rope. A single cry announced that this was enough;
and then a brief period of great suspense followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>They heard the dripping of water, accompanied
by more or less splashing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I hope he hasn&rsquo;t fallen in himself!&rdquo; Bumpus
was heard to say, with a long breath, as his
overwrought feelings almost overpowered him.</p>
<p>Then came three calls. That was the signal for
those above to draw up. Allan was already at
Thad&rsquo;s side, and ready to bend the power of his
young muscles to assist in the task, and together
they made that windlass creak at a lively rate as
they worked.</p>
<p>Bumpus was on his knees now. He acted as
though a new fear oppressed his heart. What if
the strain proved too great, and the rope parted&mdash;Giraffe
must be hurled back into the depths, and a
tragedy would be presented to them.</p>
<p>It was with the liveliest possible feeling of gratitude
that Bumpus finally saw the beloved face of
his chum appear in view above the stone coping of
the well. He was also struck with the fact that
Giraffe seemed to be grinning instead of having a
serious expression on his thin countenance.</p>
<p>Allan put out a hand and assisted him to effect a
landing on solid ground. Meanwhile the woman
had set up a renewal of her half shrieks Bumpus
could easily guess why this should be, for look as
he might he could see no sign of a child!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s poor little Benjy, Giraffe?&rdquo; the fat
scout demanded, half indignantly, for he could not
understand what it all meant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Then what did Giraffe do but thrust a hand into
the bosom of his splashed khaki coat and draw out
the queerest <i>puppy</i> Bumpus had ever seen. He
stared at the water-soaked little beast as though he
thought he might be looking at something unreal.</p>
<p>Allan burst out into a shout, while the woman
with a shriek of delight snatched little Benjy from
the hands of the one who had saved him, and kissed
his doggy mouth again and again.</p>
<p>Giraffe stood there with that grin spreading
across his face. He looked down at his wet feet
and leggings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of me taking all that trouble for a fike not
much bigger&rsquo;n a postage stamp?&rdquo; he presently exclaimed.
&ldquo;I guess the joke&rsquo;s on me this time, boys,
so laugh all you&rsquo;re a mind to. I&rsquo;m wet up to my
knees, all right; but I got dear little Benjy,
didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad clapped him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all there&rsquo;s not so much to laugh about,
Giraffe,&rdquo; he said, soberly. &ldquo;We all thought Benjy
was a child, and you risked your life to save him.
The motive is what counts every time; and I&rsquo;m sure
you did what any scout would be proud to own to;
but we&rsquo;re glad it wasn&rsquo;t a child after all, for it would
have been drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re about right there, Thad,&rdquo; the
other admitted, &ldquo;for you see the puppy could swim,
which is what a child couldn&rsquo;t do. Let&rsquo;s be going
on again, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was thirsty,&rdquo; said Bumpus, &ldquo;but I
guess I can wait till we come to a well that isn&rsquo;t
used for a swimming tank by dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman seeing them moving off tried to thank
them for having saved her little pet. Of course
not being able to talk French the boys could not
understand just what she said, though they caught
the meaning, and nodded their heads accordingly.</p>
<p>Once they were going they found occasion to
laugh again and again as different remarks were
made concerning features connected with the adventure.
Giraffe laughed louder than any one else.
He said he no longer felt sleepy, and that he believed
it would be better for him to sit with his
feet in the sun so as to dry off.</p>
<p>Half an hour afterwards it was found that they
were once more approaching what seemed to be a
bridge. Remembering the tragic occurrences that
had taken place at that other crossing of the river
the boys naturally felt more or less anxiety as to
what they might run across here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s guarded, as sure as anything,&rdquo; said Giraffe,
who had stretched his long neck in order to give
those keen eyes of his a better chance to see. &ldquo;Yes,
and by Belgian soldiers in the bargain, sure pop.
I can tell by their uniforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they won&rsquo;t think of stopping us from
crossing,&rdquo; said Bumpus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>As they drew nearer to the bridge they saw several
men in blue uniforms, and wearing high-peaked
hats, holding their guns in a significant manner as
though giving plain warning that access to the
bridge was forbidden. Thad felt from this that
they were doomed to meet with a disappointment.</p>
<p>He stopped the car close to the guard. To the
surprise of the boys one of the soldiers, evidently
guessing their nationality from the little flags which
they still wore fastened to their coats, addressed
them in very good English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not possible for you to cross the bridge!&rdquo;
was what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are hoping to reach Antwerp, where this
boy has a sick mother who needs him,&rdquo; Thad explained,
laying a hand on Bumpus&rsquo;s shoulder as he
spoke.</p>
<p>The soldier shook his head in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No car can cross the bridge after this; it would
not be safe, and would spoil all our plans for a
trap,&rdquo; he went on to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But couldn&rsquo;t you make an exception in our
case?&rdquo; asked Bumpus, trying to throw all the pathos
possible into his voice.</p>
<p>Again the soldier shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; he said, in a manner that would
admit of no further argument. &ldquo;You must turn
and follow the river road to the west. There is
another small bridge six miles that way, not strong
enough for guns to be moved over, but you might
get across. I hope you reach Antwerp safely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We happened to see the fight at the other bridge,
and watched when it was in the end blown up,&rdquo;
Giraffe ventured to say, at which the other&rsquo;s face
lighted up and just as Giraffe knew would be the
case he cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us what happened there, for we have been
wondering what all the sounds of fighting in that
direction meant. But we have had no word up to
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly Thad, assisted by the others at intervals,
related some of the stirring sights they had
seen while on the watch-hill a mile or more distant
from the battlefield at the bridge. The three
Belgians listened eagerly, and while two of the
guard might not fully understand what was said,
they caught enough to feel that their comrades had
won new honor by their gallant defense of the
bridge, and its ultimate destruction when defense
was no longer possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much for giving us such splendid
news,&rdquo; said the soldier who spoke English, as
he thrust out a hand to Thad; &ldquo;and in return I
may let you into a secret that will explain why you
cannot cross here. This bridge had been weakened
so that it is apt to fall when any weight is put on it.
Even your car might be sufficient to bring about the
catastrophe. We are hoping it will go down with
the first detachment of raiding Uhlans that comes
this way. Our duty is to fire on them and get
them to charge. If twenty go down with the bridge
so much the better.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Of course Thad realized that all thought of crossing
there must be abandoned. He saw that a road
ran along the river, and by taking this they would
after a bit come to the small bridge which was
recommended for their notice.</p>
<p>So the boys started, making up their minds that,
as Giraffe said, &ldquo;You never know what&rsquo;s best for
you; and after all our going this way may turn
out to be just splendid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;d only throw us in the way of getting a
new supply of petrol I&rsquo;d ask nothing better,&rdquo; remarked
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting pretty near high noon too, don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo;
said Bumpus, significantly; &ldquo;and human beings
have to be fed as well as cranky old engines. I
ought to have asked that accommodating fellow
whether there was any village on the bank of the
river down this way. Seems to me there must be.
Anyhow we could try every house we struck, and
see if some lady wouldn&rsquo;t get us up a dinner for
ready cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing I think we might do,&rdquo; suggested
Thad; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s lay in something at the very next
chance. I mean food to cook, together with several
pans, and a pot to boil coffee in. Then we&rsquo;d
feel independent of any inn; and if overtaken by
night could get on fairly well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus expressed delight at the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a great scheme, Thad!&rdquo; he declared,
with beaming face; &ldquo;and really I&rsquo;m surprised that
none of us have thought of that dodge before.
We&rsquo;ve got plenty of room aboard the old machine
to stow things; and for my part it&rsquo;s going to bring
up heaps of happy memories of by-gone days and
nights, when we&rsquo;ve sat around a jolly camp fire with
our mates.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then that settles it,&rdquo; decided the scout leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Thad,&rdquo; called out Giraffe, after one of his
observations, &ldquo;unless all signs are wrong we&rsquo;re going
to have a chance to get some dinner, and p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps
lay in all those stores, because there&rsquo;s a village ahead
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That eagle eye of yours is correct as usual, Giraffe,&rdquo;
said Allan, after taking a look for himself.</p>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;A TEMPEST IN A TEAPOT.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Bumpus seemed to scent more trouble ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I certainly do hope we&rsquo;ll be able to get
what we want here at this place,&rdquo; he went on to
remark, dubiously. &ldquo;So few of these Belgians in
this section of the country understand plain United
States as she is spoken. We&rsquo;ll have to make use
of signs to bargain with them for our grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Bumpus began to practice what he
imagined was a good idea for showing he was
hungry, and wanted to buy food. He rubbed his
stomach, sighed heavily, then pointed to his open
mouth and champed his jaws vigorously, after which
he smiled sweetly, and, with a nod of his head, held
up a franc.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;ll be able to satisfy anybody going that
your proper place is in an asylum, Bumpus, if you
carry on that way,&rdquo; jeered Giraffe; &ldquo;you leave it all
to Thad and Allan and me. We have the goods,
and can deliver them. They&rsquo;re all wool and a yard
wide, let me tell you, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the car entered the village, and pulled up in
the most likely place the pilot could see. This was
where there seemed to be some sort of open-air
market, with all manner of things good to eat exposed
for sale.</p>
<p>Their coming of course excited considerable interest.
People began to cluster around the car
as soon as it stopped. Curious eyes observed the
inmates, with their natty khaki uniforms. Of course
there were few among them but who realized that
these lads must be Boy Scouts, but they seemed to
understand immediately that they were not of the
Belgian type.</p>
<p>The boys jumped out and started to try and find
some one who could understand what they desired
to do. Bumpus alone was left sitting there in the
car, and he amused himself looking around. When
he thought his chums were well out of sight he concluded
to try his little scheme; so taking a coin from
his pocket he held it up and began his grotesque
motions.</p>
<p>At first the crowd seemed to watch him in wonder.
Then they began to say things among themselves,
and smile. After that some of the half-grown
boys laughed rudely, and began to mimic
poor Bumpus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>This humiliated him so that he stopped his show,
realizing that they were beginning to look on him
as some sort of circus performer, perhaps a hokus-pokus
medicine fakir on his travels, and trying to
gather a crowd around before opening his box of
goods for sale.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the other boys were trying to find
some one who could talk English, in order to engage
a midday meal, and later on purchase what supplies
they needed.</p>
<p>Thad noticed almost immediately that there was
a scarcity of able-bodied men in the river village.
He knew the reason, because every one capable of
bearing arms had been hurried to the front to try
and resist the invaders.</p>
<p>Women, old men, cripples, and children of all
sizes made up the population of the place, and Thad
really believed the entire village must have come
out of doors to size up the strangers within their
gates.</p>
<p>Although at the time he did not imagine any harm
could come of their separating, Thad afterwards
wished he had insisted on the other two keeping
with him. If that had been done possibly they
would have been saved from more or less inconvenience,
not to use a harsher term.</p>
<p>The patrol leader had just managed to locate what
looked like a sort of tavern where possibly they
could make arrangements for a dinner, if they
waited until it could be prepared, when he saw part
of the crowd heaving in a strange way. At the
same time loud angry voices began to reach his ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Allan was hurrying towards him from another
direction, as though he too had noticed the upheaval
and considered it best that they consolidate
their forces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be Giraffe who&rsquo;s gone and gotten himself
into trouble some way or other,&rdquo; Allan was saying
hurriedly as he joined Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know,&rdquo; added the other, &ldquo;because
they&rsquo;re pushing this way now. Yes, and there&rsquo;s
Giraffe in the lead too. See him brush off the hands
of those women and boys. They look excited
enough to tear him to pieces! This is a bad job,
I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can have happened to cause it?&rdquo; said
Allan, glancing back uneasily toward the car, and
finding that it was near at hand, with the alarmed
Bumpus already standing up to observe what was
going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Thad, hurriedly, &ldquo;Giraffe has
been unwise enough in trying to make himself understood
to air his German, and that&rsquo;s made these
people suspect we may be spies sent on ahead of the
army to get the lay of the land, and learn where
they&rsquo;re hiding all their valuables and wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another minute Giraffe came hurrying up. He
was looking disturbed, and a little white of face,
though his teeth were clenched, and there was an
ominous glitter in his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the row about, Giraffe?&rdquo; asked Thad,
though he had to speak much louder than ordinary
on account of the noise made by the increasing mob.</p>
<p>Boys were whooping, women shrieking and chattering
as they shook their fists toward the four
strangers, and taken in all the prospect was decidedly
stormy. No wonder Bumpus was rubbing
his chubby hands together, and staring with open
mouth at the &ldquo;tempest in a teapot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what ails the sillies!&rdquo; cried Giraffe,
indignantly. &ldquo;I was trying my best to make them
understand that we wanted a dinner and to buy
some food. One fellow turned around and shouted
something to the others. Then they began to flock
about me like people at a county fair do when
the snake-charmer comes out of the side-show to
give an exhibition with her scaly pets. Say, they
even tried to lay hands on me but I shook &rsquo;em off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Thad, sternly, &ldquo;did you try any
of your German on them?&rdquo; demanded Thad.</p>
<p>Giraffe wilted at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I own up I did, Thad!&rdquo; he confessed.
&ldquo;You see I thought some of them might
be able to understand the language, and I bet you
they do too; but whee! they acted mad at me. I
never thought my German was as rank as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand that German is in bad
favor through Belgium just now? Those who do
speak it are trying to forget all they know. When
strangers drop into a Belgian village and talk it,
with the Kaiser&rsquo;s army only a few miles away, it&rsquo;s
only natural they suspect us. Now I&rsquo;ve got to try
like everything to set things right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>So saying Thad turned to the shouting crowd,
and held up his hand. Somehow there was something
about the boy to inspire confidence. The
yelling and jeering gradually died down. Several
old men cowed the boys and the women. Possibly
they told them to give the stranger a chance to
explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any one here who talks English?&rdquo;
called out Thad.</p>
<p>At that an old man pushed his way forward
through the crowd. Judging from the deference
shown him by the others he must be a person of
considerable importance in this humble little village
on the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, young m&rsquo;sieu,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I lived in London
some years, and learned the language. What is it
you desire to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad smiled. He knew now he would be able
to convince these good people that far from being
German spies or even sympathizers, he and his
chums were deeply concerned over the threatened
fate of poor little Belgium, in danger of being made
the battleground for warring neighbors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are American Boy Scouts,&rdquo; he started to
say. &ldquo;We have been traveling through the country,
and had just made a trip down the Rhine when we
heard that war had broken out. One of my friends
has a sick mother in Antwerp. We are trying our
best to make our way to her. We bought this
old car to help us along. When we get to our
journey&rsquo;s end we expect to turn it over to the
authorities, if they can make any use of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why does this young m&rsquo;sieu speak the hated
language?&rdquo; asked the old man, looking straight at
Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He learned it in school, and thought some one
might be able to understand him,&rdquo; continued the
scout leader. &ldquo;He was asking where we could
buy some dinner, and then a few supplies afterwards.
That is all. It was not wise for him to
expose his knowledge of German, but the very fact
that he did so proves he meant no wrong. See, we
have our passports to prove who we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man came closer, to look the documents
over. Thad just then felt glad to remember that
he had concealed in the lining of his hat the paper
given him by the German aviator whose life they
had saved. It might have been very unpleasant for
the boys had this been found on his person.</p>
<p>Besides the passports Thad exhibited several letters
he had received from across the water since
coming abroad. Allan and Giraffe also contributed
their quota to this display. It really had more influence
on the old villager than the official documents,
which might be false after all, but he knew
those stamps and post-marks must be the genuine
thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>The old man turned and talked to the crowd.
Evidently what he said impressed the assemblage,
for their angry looks gave way to others of a more
genial nature, though some of the half-grown boys
continued to get their heads together, and confer
mysteriously, as they looked at the car with Bumpus
in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the proprietor of the inn,&rdquo; said their
friend, the old villager, who had once worked at his
trade in the great city across the Channel. &ldquo;He has
promised to supply you with dinner in half an hour.
If you wish to buy anything you are at liberty to
do so. But I would not leave the car alone, for
something might happen to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad told Giraffe to get in along with Bumpus
while he and Allan made what purchases they had
in mind. As fast as these were secured, which was
only after more or less argument in the deaf and
dumb alphabet, the boys carried the things to the
car and stowed them away.</p>
<p>Bumpus saw that in the end they were well supplied
with enough food to last several meals, as
well as a tin pail in which they could boil coffee.</p>
<p>As the half hour was now about up they took the
car into the inn-yard, and Thad meant to keep an
eye on it if possible while they ate their dinner.
This was rendered possible because he sat where
he could look out of an open window; but after all
nothing out of the way happened.</p>
<p>The boys noticed that there had been a bridge
at this place, but it seemed to have been destroyed
by some flood, for a new one was under construction,
though only partly built, and of no use at that
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>This of course necessitated their going further
along the river road until they arrived at the small
bridge of which they had been told by the Belgian
soldiers some time before.</p>
<p>There was no fault to be found with their meal.
Even Bumpus admitted that it tasted good, and was
in abundance. So the four scouts arose with a
feeling of satisfaction, and Thad settled the account.
It is not a very hard matter to pay bills,
even when two parties are unable to speak each
other&rsquo;s language, for signs and the sight of money
go a long way toward settlement.</p>
<p>As they passed out Thad saw their old friend
beckoning to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in the car, fellows, and I&rsquo;ll join you as soon
as I&rsquo;ve had a few words with the old chap, and
thanked him heartily for his friendly act,&rdquo; said the
leader.</p>
<p>A few minutes afterwards he came hurrying
toward them, and when Giraffe saw the way Thad&rsquo;s
brows were knitted he knew some new trouble was
in store for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s coming next, Thad?&rdquo; he asked, and if
any one had taken the pains to look beneath the
surface they might have found an undercurrent of
satisfaction in the tones of the tall scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our good old friend has warned me that a parcel
of the rougher boys of the village have started out,
meaning to waylay us, and take our car away. He
says they&rsquo;ve got an idea we&rsquo;ve no business riding
around when their military authorities need every
sort of motor car they can get. And that&rsquo;s how the
land lies, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">THE AMBUSCADE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s a nice kettle of fish!&rdquo; burst out
Bumpus, fixing his eyes on the scout leader, as
though mentally asking what Thad meant to do.</p>
<p>The actions of Giraffe spoke louder than words
could have done. With a really wicked grin he
reached down and took something in his hand which
it seemed he had stowed away in the body of the
car. It was a club almost the size of a baseball bat,
one of those home-run kind boys talk about, and
call &ldquo;the old wagon-tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I had a sort of hunch this would come in
handy sooner or later, and now I know it!&rdquo; Giraffe
muttered, with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you suppose this means, Thad?&rdquo;
asked Allan, with a puzzled look on his face. &ldquo;I
always understood these Belgian boys were well-behaved
chaps, and the last ones in the world to do
a thing like this. If we were in some town across
in our own country it wouldn&rsquo;t seem so strange.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop and think for a minute what&rsquo;s happening
here in Belgium this very day,&rdquo; said Thad. &ldquo;A
million Germans have overrun the country, and
every Belgian capable of bearing arms is hurrying
to the battle line. Of course the boys are worked
up to fever heat. You all saw how they acted when
that mob surrounded us. They&rsquo;re not the same
well-behaved boys they were two weeks ago. The
excitement has settled in their brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Thad, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ve got to hand
them over the old car, does it?&rdquo; asked Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he was assured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we have to turn back again so as to keep
from having a row?&rdquo; continued the fat scout,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should hope not,&rdquo; burst out Giraffe,
angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be willing to turn back before the
majesty of the whole German army, but I&rsquo;ll be
hanged if I want to knuckle down to a pack of kids.
If you ask my opinion there it is, straight goods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;that I think
has had some influence on these boys, or given
them the idea of holding us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to a fence across from the inn-yard.
It had some gaudy bills pasted on it, which apparently
none of the others had noticed before,
though taught to use their eyes as scouts on every
occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, those look mighty familiar!&rdquo; said Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried Giraffe. &ldquo;A regular American
Wild West show over here in Belgium, raking
in the coin this last summer? Thad, if that gave
an exhibition here, or anywhere close by, I can
understand what you mean. The kids must have
been practicing throwing the rope, and holding up
stages ever since. Yes, by George! that&rsquo;s where they
get this idea from, as sure as anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After all, the world is getting smaller all the
time,&rdquo; remarked Allan, &ldquo;when you can find such
pictures as those thousands of miles away from
home. Before long it may be all Japan, China and
India will be looking at our cowboys perform, and
the Indians hold up stage coaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they do that already,&rdquo; Thad told him;
&ldquo;for the moving pictures are being shown all around
the world. But I&rsquo;ve got an idea. Wait here for me,
fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the scout leader hurried away, leaving
the trio to talk matters over, and trying to guess
what he had in view. A short time later Thad
reappeared, with a little package in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just happened to notice some whips for sale
at a store in the place,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve
bought several. If we&rsquo;re forced to we&rsquo;ll use them
on those boys the best we know how. The old man
told me they were the bad lot of the village, so you
see they do have them even over in Belgium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How that takes me back to dear old Cranford,&rdquo;
sighed Bumpus, &ldquo;where we used to have all manner
of times with Brose Griffin and his cronies, Eli
Bangs and Walt Hopkins. So they have a rowdy
element here too, do they? Thad, I hope you didn&rsquo;t
forget me when laying in that stock of cowhides?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three covered the entire stock they had,&rdquo; the
other told him; &ldquo;and so Giraffe will have to depend
on that club of his; only I hope he uses it carefully.
It&rsquo;s big and heavy enough to floor anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe nodded, and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ll be on the watch not to knock the poor
chaps silly, if they take warning, and clear out,&rdquo;
he remarked, as he hid the article in question away,
but in a place where it could be quickly seized.</p>
<p>It was in anything but a pleasant humor that
Thad prepared to leave the village where they had
been hospitably entertained, after that first little
misunderstanding. He did not like this idea of
meeting the attack of the Belgian boys with violence,
but there seemed to be no other way, for the old
man had declined to ride out with them, saying
that he did not wish to be connected at all with
the matter, and considered his duty done in giving
them due warning.</p>
<p>Thad was really under the impression that he
would not be sorry if the boys received some sort of
drubbing to pay them for their audacity in treating
strangers in the way they intended.</p>
<p>There was no choice about the route; it was necessary
that they go up or down the river, since no
other road led away from the place. Of course
across the river there was one they would have
been glad to have taken, only with the bridge gone
it was not possible to get the car over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody waving his hand to us, Thad, over
there at that cottage window,&rdquo; observed the watchful
Giraffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think it must be our old friend,&rdquo; said Thad,
as he made haste to answer the signal. &ldquo;Yes, I can
see his face now, and his gray beard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed out of the village, with the people
simply looking after them, for all signs of resentment
had apparently died out. These good folks
had too many serious troubles of their own to
think of hunting up new ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how far we&rsquo;ll get before they jump
out at us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was Bumpus trying to secure an opinion.
It was one of his ways of fishing for what he
called &ldquo;a rise.&rdquo; And as usual Giraffe hastened to
accommodate him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! not far, you can depend on it, Bumpus,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;because they haven&rsquo;t been gone long, and
would have to tramp it. I reckon now they&rsquo;d just
want to get say half a mile or so outside the place,
so the racket they kick up won&rsquo;t reach the ears of
their folks here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undo the package, Allan,&rdquo; said Thad, with a
business-like air.</p>
<p>This being done disclosed three stout whips of
the type often spoken of as &ldquo;cowhides.&rdquo; Bumpus
immediately took possession of one, and seemed to
be as tickled as a child with a new toy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just prime stuff, Thad,&rdquo; he asserted.
&ldquo;Course I&rsquo;ve never dusted any fellow&rsquo;s jacket with
such a thing, and I don&rsquo;t hanker after the job now;
but what has to be can&rsquo;t be helped. I&rsquo;ll promise you
to do my level best to sting their legs, for that&rsquo;s the
best way, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Giraffe looked at the whips rather enviously.
Possibly he almost felt sorry he had displayed that
ferocious club so hastily; only for that he might
have been given one of the cowhides to manipulate,
instead of Bumpus.</p>
<p>They had by this time left the village behind
them. The river lay on their left, and the further
bank was not very far away. Thad was watching
the road in advance, as though mentally figuring on
where they would run across the ambuscade planned
by these bellicose Belgian boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some sort of a turn I can see up yonder,
Thad,&rdquo; ventured Giraffe, with his neck stretched in
his favorite manner when sighting things, and which
peculiarity had given him his queer nick-name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a bend, all right,&rdquo; added Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just around a place like that would offer a fine
chance to jump out on us, I&rsquo;d think,&rdquo; suggested
Giraffe.</p>
<p>He was bending down while speaking, and taking
hold of his cudgel as though intending to be ready
when the call to duty came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Thad, impressively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stop
the car the very second they come in sight. The
chances are they&rsquo;ll have the road blocked in some
way, so as to prevent our getting past. Then when
I give the word everybody get out in a hurry, and
meet their rush with the liveliest business you know
how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say how many there were in this
bunch, did he, Thad?&rdquo; asked Bumpus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I forgot to ask him,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way with scouts always,&rdquo; said Giraffe,
pompously. &ldquo;When danger comes along a scout
shouldn&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;How many are there of the enemy,&rsquo;
but just shout out, &lsquo;Where are they, so I can get
busy?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a dozen or ten, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said
Allan, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re primed to scatter them like chaff before
the wind. Remember they are bringing all this
trouble down on their own silly heads. It isn&rsquo;t any
of our choosing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in this resolute spirit then that they approached
the bend in the river road, around which
they fully expected to find trouble lurking. Bumpus
was so tremendously excited that he actually seemed
to be holding his breath. His blue eyes were round,
and staring at that curve in the road now dreadfully
near; and if the hand that gripped that tough
cowhide trembled it was from nervous tension, not
fear.</p>
<p>Apparently all was calm and peaceful about that
spot. Not a single sign of anything unusual could
the four scouts detect as they came close to the
bend. Doubtless watchful eyes had noted their
coming, and the news had been duly conveyed to
those who were in hiding, so that they would know
when to commence operations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Now the car had reached the turn and was commencing
to negotiate it. Whatever was in store for
the chums it could not be longer delayed. Still, so
far as they could see after swinging around the
curve, the road was perfectly clear of all manner of
obstacles, which fact rather surprised Giraffe, who
had evidently anticipated discovering a log thrown
in such a way as to completely barricade the thoroughfare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they don&rsquo;t seem to be here after all,
Thad!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Giraffe spoke just a second too soon. In fact
hardly had the last word left his lips when there
was something doing just ahead of them.</p>
<p>A shrill whistle sounded, and at that the bushes
on both sides of the road seemed to be alive with
leaping figures. Some seven or eight boys had been
concealed there, and now hurried out on the road.
Some of them carried branches, others stones, and
still more hastened to throw a half-rotten log across
the road, effectually blocking it for the passage of a
vehicle, especially a car.</p>
<p>Thad was ready for just this sort of thing. He
instantly shut off the power and there was no
trouble whatever in coaxing the car to come to a
complete standstill&mdash;there never was any complaint
along this score, all the anxiety being in the other
direction.</p>
<p>Immediately the Belgian boys rushed to surround
the car. Their actions were very threatening, for
they shouted, and waved their arms, and several
even had sticks with which they cut the air venomously.
Perhaps they expected that the four boys
in khaki would just naturally throw up their hands
in the same way the actors in the American show
had done when the road-agents were robbing the
stage coach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>It was a mistake, and those Belgian lads discovered
this for themselves before five more seconds
had passed. Instead of displaying a willingness to
yield without any struggle the strangers immediately
started in to &ldquo;rough house&rdquo; it in the most approved
fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go for &rsquo;em!&rdquo; shouted Giraffe, as he made a leap
over the side of the car, just as furiously as he had
many a time in the past accomplished a &ldquo;flying
tackle&rdquo; in battling for his school colors on the
gridiron.</p>
<p>The others were not far behind him, even clumsy
Bumpus displaying unwonted agility in bouncing out
of the car, rawhide in hand.</p>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="small">THE SCOUTS&rsquo; CAMP FIRE.</span></h2>
<p>It was certainly pretty lively while it lasted.
Giraffe, who liked excitement must have felt quite
in his element when turning the tables on those
plotting Belgian boys who had figured in taking
their car away from them, so as to offer it to the
Government, just then so sadly in need of transportation
facilities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>However laudable their ambition may have been
Thad and his three friends were determined that
they would block the game. With this purpose in
view they commenced to spring a pretty surprise
on their assailants.</p>
<p>The three who wielded the whips started to flay
the legs of the ambushing force, and immediately
the shouts that had been intended to intimidate the
scouts began to change their tune and become yells.</p>
<p>Giraffe, too, was swinging that club with his old-time
vigor. True, he had no particular animosity
against these native boys who thought they were
only doing a patriotic duty; but Giraffe believed he
had a right to fight for his property, and he claimed
a quarter interest in that car, miserable affair though
it was.</p>
<p>Had the Belgian boys been equipped with the
same type of weapons as Thad and his chums it
might have been a longer battle, for they would
probably given as good as they took. Since the
advantage was all on one side, save in numbers, the
end was a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>Some of the astonished boys started to run, then
came back and took a second generous dose, before
concluding that the game was up.</p>
<p>A signal was finally given which must have been
the recall, for immediately the wielders of the
whips and the club found their occupation gone,
since their adversaries had retreated in hot haste.</p>
<p>Thad saw that they darted into the brush, and
suspected their main object was to secure some sort
of fighting material for themselves, after which
they would likely return to the attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>He did not want any more of that rough and
tumble sort of scramble if it could be avoided; and
a quick &ldquo;getaway&rdquo; was the one thing needful in
such a case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear the road!&rdquo; he called out, suiting his actions
to his words by jumping forward to seize hold of the
log, which with a few adroit turns he sent spinning
into the ditch.</p>
<p>The others hastened to do their share, and in less
time than it takes to tell it a passage had been made
through the barricade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; called Thad, giving his orders
with the precision of a military commander; &ldquo;now
get aboard, for we&rsquo;re going to start off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus had been expecting something like this.
Knowing his faculty for lagging he was already
&ldquo;legging&rdquo; it for the car when Thad spoke. Thus
he managed to clamber aboard in good time, and
fall on his knees inside the tonneau of the car.</p>
<p>Giraffe came flying after him, landing almost on
his back; but a little thing like that was not to be
noticed when the main object had been accomplished.
They had managed to get rid of their
tormentors for the time being, and this gave Thad
a chance to start the engine.</p>
<p>There was fortunately no need of cranking, and
hardly had Allan clutched hold of the car to swing
himself aboard when it was moving off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duck your heads, everybody; they&rsquo;re going to
bombard us with stones!&rdquo; shouted Giraffe, as a
missile struck the back of the car with a bang.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Several came aboard, and one by some freak of
fortune took Bumpus square in the back, causing
him to give a loud grunt, though he declared it was
nothing to bother about.</p>
<p>The fusillade continued until the car, increasing
its momentum, managed to draw so far away that
the stones fell short. When this became a certainty
Giraffe, looking back, told them the Belgian boys
had given up the pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! guess that was a case of the biter bitten!&rdquo;
said Giraffe, assuming all the airs of a victor expecting
to be crowned with the laurel wreath; although
if the question had been actually put to him
he must have admitted that three other fellows
had also had a &ldquo;finger in the pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got out of the scrape better than I thought
we would,&rdquo; said Bumpus, &ldquo;when I saw how many
of them there were. Giraffe, you&rsquo;re a good friend
of mine, ain&rsquo;t you? Would you mind rubbing me
in the middle of the back? Please not <i>quite</i> so
hard, for you see that rock gave me a bit of a clump
there, and raised a knob, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering what&rsquo;s going to strike us next,&rdquo;
ventured Allan; &ldquo;for when you come to look at it
we&rsquo;ve been having some of the queerest adventures
on this trip that ever could have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus shook his head as though he might be
ready to pass the puzzle along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too deep for me, Allan,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d think
we&rsquo;d pretty nearly exhausted the whole list by now,
but still there may be more coming. It&rsquo;s making me
believe we&rsquo;re fated not to get through with this car,
after all, and that we&rsquo;ll soon run up against a snag
so big that it&rsquo;ll sink our craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as we don&rsquo;t go down with it I won&rsquo;t
kick,&rdquo; asserted Giraffe, who seemed to be feeling
much more cheery since that last little exciting affair.
&ldquo;And Bumpus, after all what does it matter
how you get to Antwerp so long as you pull up
there sooner or later?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m getting reconciled to almost anything,&rdquo;
admitted Bumpus, showing that this constant series
of happenings was beginning to have an effect on
even his stubborn nature, just as water dripping constantly
will wear away a stone in the course of time.</p>
<p>Thus talking they moved speedily along the river
road until finally Giraffe announced he had sighted
the bridge over which they hoped to be able to cross
the stream, and head once more for the big city on
the Schelde.</p>
<p>There were some Belgian soldiers on guard here
also, possibly older men who had not expected to
go to the front, yet had a certain line of duty to
perform in this the latest crisis of their beloved
country&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Just as Thad expected they had to stop and give
an account of themselves, as well as show their
passports, and the letters with the American stamps.
They were again lucky in having one of the Belgians
able to talk with them, for it turned out that
he had been in America, and even asked them how
Hoboken was getting along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Satisfied with being permitted to cross the bridge
and pursue their journey the four scouts waved
good-bye to the guards and started on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was a hard river to cross let me tell
you,&rdquo; said Giraffe after they reached the other side.
&ldquo;Just stop and think how many times we&rsquo;ve been
knocked out of our calculations. There was the
battle we saw that blocked us; then the bridge that
had been fixed to trap some of the raiding Uhlans
when they came galloping along, and tried to rush
things; after that there was the one that was being
built in the village, and which of course we couldn&rsquo;t
use; and at last we struck oil up here, many miles
out of our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me we&rsquo;ve been pushing backwards
part of the time, Thad, instead of advancing,&rdquo; ventured
Bumpus. &ldquo;Makes me think of the boy who
was late to school and told the teacher that every
time he took a step forward he slipped back two;
and when the teacher asked him how he ever managed
to get there he said he just turned around and
headed the other way; so mebbe that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re
doing. Where do you figure we are now, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As near as I can find out,&rdquo; replied the scout
leader, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not far from the town called Moll,
which is on the railroad. There&rsquo;s a canal somewhere
nearby, that swings around to the city of
Turnhout, and then still on to Antwerp. I should
say that we&rsquo;re not more than seven miles or so
from the Dutch border.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And how far from Antwerp?&rdquo; asked Bumpus,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the crow flies not more than thirty miles,
perhaps,&rdquo; Thad explained; &ldquo;but the way things are
upset here in Belgium, that stands for hard sledding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the canal right now, after we cross the
railroad,&rdquo; ventured Giraffe, to whom it was all
getting very interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the sun is going down before a great while,
you notice,&rdquo; said Bumpus, because they had been
held up for nearly two hours while Thad tinkered
with that horrible engine again, and deemed himself
lucky to get it started even then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and as we&rsquo;ve settled on staying outdoors to-night,&rdquo;
said Allan, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s be on the watch for a decent
place to make camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think of our having a chance to do that
over here in Belgium, with battles going on all
around us,&rdquo; Giraffe remarked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make those
other scouts turn green with envy when we relate
all our adventures on this trip. It was fine enough
coming down the Rhine, but then nothing queer
happened to us like we&rsquo;ve been up against the last
few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short time later they struck what looked like
an ideal place for stopping overnight. Just here
there were no houses in sight, though of course the
boys did not know what lay beyond, perhaps a village
or a town. Belgium is so thickly populated that
very little ground is allowed to remain idle, or be
planted in trees, but just here there was a strip of
woods that had a most inviting look.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>So the car was run in and they started to make
themselves comfortable, as scouts of long experience
might be expected to do when surrounded by similar
conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that when we&rsquo;re just sitting down to
supper, after cooking the same,&rdquo; Bumpus remarked,
pensively, &ldquo;some old gruff Belgian farmer doesn&rsquo;t
come hurrying up, complaining because we&rsquo;ve trespassed
on his property, and making us clear out bag
and baggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Bumpus that represented the sum total of
depravity; it meant a catastrophe without limit, and
something to cause a shudder, even in the bare contemplation;
for it meant hunger, and that was always
a calamity in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much danger,&rdquo; Allan told him, &ldquo;because you
may have noticed I&rsquo;m making this fire small, and
out of extra-dry stuff. Scouts know that if you
take green wood you&rsquo;ll always get a smoke that
can be seen far off. That&rsquo;s what we use it for when
we want to communicate by smoke signals. But
Bumpus, if you were fifty feet away I don&rsquo;t think
you could notice smoke from this wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I warrant you he could sense cooking going
on, all right,&rdquo; Giraffe laughingly observed. &ldquo;You
never can fool Bumpus on that. He can scent an
onion frying half a mile away, can&rsquo;t you, Bumpus?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t deny the soft impeachment, for I know
I&rsquo;ve got a splendid nose for grub,&rdquo; admitted the
good-natured scout.</p>
<p>Although the means for cooking supper were
somewhat primitive because these boys had always
been accustomed to having a full kit along with
them, still they knew how to manage. Consequently
in good time, just as it was getting dusk, the meal
was pronounced ready, and all of them gathered
around to share in its disposal, a duty that no one
ever complained of.</p>
<p>They were hungry, and somehow the familiar
odors seemed to give an edge to their appetites that
nothing else had done.</p>
<p>For a little while talking ceased, because every
one was too busily engaged to bother making any
remark. Then as the edge was taken off their appetites
they commenced to exchange comments on
the doings of that particular day, which could always
be marked with a white stone in their memories.</p>
<p>Suddenly and without the slightest warning there
came a terrific sneeze that startled them all. It
came from the bushes close at hand, that much even
Bumpus knew. Of course every eye was turned in
that direction, being focussed on a certain spot
where the bushes seemed to be moving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>As they stared, hardly knowing what to expect,
there arose the lanky form of a man. He made no
hostile move, but stood there looking at them; and
Bumpus even fancied he was sniffing the air, just
as a half-starved dog might, when approaching the
spot where a feast was being devoured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot, gents!&rdquo; this singular being called
out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not dangerous at all, only as hungry as
a wolf. From what I&rsquo;ve heard you saying I opine
that you&rsquo;re American the same as myself; and I&rsquo;m
sure hoping you&rsquo;ll invite me up to join you in a
snack.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><span class="small">A TATTOOED FUGITIVE.</span></h2>
<p>Thad did not wait to consult his chums on hearing
what the forlorn figure standing amidst the
bushes said; he knew they would back him up in his
generous impulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are an American you&rsquo;ll be doubly welcome
here,&rdquo; he called out; &ldquo;but no matter where you came
from, if you&rsquo;re hungry we&rsquo;ve got plenty and to
spare. Step this way and join us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man did not hesitate after that warm invitation,
but hustled forward. They looked curiously
at him, and no wonder, for he was apparently no
ordinary individual. His sleeves were rolled up to
the elbow and it could be seen that his arms were
fairly covered with the most wonderful colored
tattoo marks imaginable. Really it looked like the
work of an artist in this line; and Bumpus, who
had never gazed upon such a sight stared as though
the other were a curiosity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>It turned out that this was just what he was, and
Thad suspected it the first thing he discovered those
tell-tale marks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the stranger, as he joined the
scouts, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the wonderful tattooed man of the great
circus and Wild West Show that has been exhibiting
in Belgium this summer. We got caught when the
war broke out so suddenly. Our boss told every one
to look out for himself or herself, and with that
the whole show went to smash. The last I saw of
our Injuns they were being herded up by the authorities
of the town where we separated. They
were afraid they&rsquo;d start on the warpath, and scalp
everybody, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down here on this log,&rdquo; said Allan, &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;ll help you to some coffee and whatever we&rsquo;ve
got. It&rsquo;s lucky we cooked much more than we
needed. I think Bumpus and Giraffe must have
expected company, or else overrated their own appetites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpus and Giraffe sound good to me!&rdquo; declared
the tall stranger, as he looked with a smile
at the two boys designated; &ldquo;somehow hearing those
names gives me a feeling that I&rsquo;m still with the
Big Show. But I want to tell you it&rsquo;s a piece of
great luck for me to meet up with you boys. To
look for Americans over here is as bad as hunting
a needle in a haystack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve been having a hard time, I take
it?&rdquo; remarked Thad, as he heaped a pan with food
and turned it over to their unexpected guest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hard!&rdquo; echoed the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful to be
alive, and outside of a dungeon to-night. And what
d&rsquo;ye think it all comes from but my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What might that be?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst any poor man marooned in Belgium
or France could own up to right now,&rdquo; replied the
other; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Kaiser!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my stars!&rdquo; ejaculated Bumpus. &ldquo;I should
say so; and you couldn&rsquo;t change it, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d been billed under my own name as the greatest
freak alive, the man whose body was decorated
with more dragons and flags and pretty girls than
anything ever seen before. Yes, and until a week
ago I was proud of that name of Kaiser. Now it
threatens to be the death of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He groaned a little, and then started to eating
voraciously. After a while, when he had seemingly
taken the sharp edge off his appetite, he condescended
to explain further, knowing of course that his
kind entertainers must be curious to hear his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, they know me all over Belgium by now.
Crowds would stand and stare at me, and try to
ask questions. The boss had to keep an interpreter
nearby to answer these. Some of them were terribly
foolish. It even seemed to many of these
simple people that I was in some way connected by
blood with Kaiser Wilhelm; and fool that I was, I
never bothered correcting that silly idea. Bitterly
have I repented that mistake. It has cost me
dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After the circus disbanded and you had to shift
for yourself,&rdquo; remarked Thad, &ldquo;I suppose you
thought to get out of the country before the fighting
began?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at first I wasn&rsquo;t in any hurry,&rdquo; came the
reply, with a shrug of the bony shoulders of the
side-show freak. &ldquo;When I did wake up and get
busy it was just too late. You see the people remembered
that I was a Kaiser, and they had it in
for me. Oh! what I have suffered. Turned back
one day, kicked out of a town the next, threatened
with prison, and doors shut in my face when I tried
to beg or buy something to eat, I&rsquo;ve lived the life
of a dog for days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was too bad,&rdquo; said the kind-hearted
Bumpus; &ldquo;here, let me fill your tin cup again with
coffee, Mr. Kaiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t mention that name again above a
whisper, while we&rsquo;re in Belgium,&rdquo; pleaded the other.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like showing a red flag to a mad bull. Call
me Bob, if you feel like it, boys. I&rsquo;ll come to any
name these days, especially if there&rsquo;s a feed like
this goes with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you aiming to do next?&rdquo; asked Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m heading north the best I can,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;When after being kicked and cuffed around I
found that it was useless to hope to get to Antwerp
where I might steam over to England, I knew that
the next best thing for me to do was to cross into
the Netherlands, where they wouldn&rsquo;t abuse me on
account of my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you a German?&rdquo; asked Giraffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was born in the good old United States,&rdquo; replied
the freak. &ldquo;I believe my ancestors did come
from the Fatherland, but to tell you the truth I
haven&rsquo;t a bit of German feeling in me. I&rsquo;m Yankee
to the backbone. I ran away as a boy, and have
knocked about the four corners of the world, principally
in the Far East, where all this wonderful
tattoo work was done for me, a little at a time.
When I&rsquo;m done eating I&rsquo;ll let you see what my body
looks like. I&rsquo;m told that there&rsquo;s nothing like it
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like being a freak?&rdquo; asked Bumpus,
innocently.</p>
<p>The man looked at him and smiled. Every one
liked Bumpus from the first, because there was
something so candid and sincere about him. You
could look straight into those blue eyes of his and
believe that there was no hypocrisy or deceit lurking
back of their depths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, son, I do and I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the other finally
replied. &ldquo;I know now I was a fool to get this
done, but once it was started, there could be no
rubbing it out, you understand, because it&rsquo;s picked
in with indelible colors. It gets me a living by exhibiting
myself, and people do lots of mighty queer
things for that, in their journey through this old
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you had the chance again would you
allow it to be done?&rdquo; asked Giraffe, who himself
had an anchor in blue upon his arm, of which he
had been rather proud in the past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I was in my right senses,&rdquo; came the
prompt reply. &ldquo;To tell you the truth the first tattooing
I had was given to me against my will when
I was held a prisoner among some wild men in
Borneo. They thought my white skin was a good
background to display the art of their boss tattooer.
Later on the crazy idea came to me to have it continued,
and then join some show. I think with
what little money I&rsquo;ve got saved over in Philadelphia
I&rsquo;ll buy a farm and settle down, if only I&rsquo;m
lucky enough to get out of this war-cursed country
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later on the fugitive circus freak did let the boys
look him over, and all of them united in declaring
that he certainly was a wonderful exhibition of the
art of tattooing in bright colors. Giraffe mentally
decided, however, that he would never allow another
anchor, or any other design for that matter, to be
placed upon his arms. This awful example had
effectually cured his leaning in that direction.</p>
<p>The man sat there for fully two hours and entertained
his young hosts with amazing stories connected
with his adventurous past. Whether they were
all true or not might always be open to suspicion,
but then none of the scouts doubted that he had
been through a maze of exploits, equal to anything
they had ever read in those books so dear to the heart
of youth, &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Swiss Family Robinson,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sindbad the Sailor&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Arabian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Later on they disposed of themselves the best way
they could, and managed to secure more or less
sleep while the night lasted.</p>
<p>Nothing occurred to disturb them. If there were
various sounds heard during the time that the moon
rode high in the heavens they were not of a character
to cause any alarm.</p>
<p>So morning found them, and breakfast was prepared
in much the same fashion as supper had been
on the preceding evening. Bob Kaiser was loud in
his protestations of gratitude as he shook the hand
of each scout at parting. He told them he would
never forget what they had done for him; and from
that time forth he meant to say a good word for
scouts wherever he went.</p>
<p>When the four lads saw him last, as they moved
off along the road, he was waving farewell in answer
to their salute, before turning his face toward
the north.</p>
<p>Upon the whole they were very glad such an opportunity
to extend a helping hand had come to
them. It must always please a genuine scout to be
of assistance to any one in distress; and the fact
that the party had been a fellow American added
to the satisfaction they felt.</p>
<p>The man had told them he had friends at Amsterdam
who would look out for him if only he could
get there; and with a reasonable amount of good
luck he surely ought to be able to cover the seven
miles, more or less, between their camping place and
the border, during the day ahead of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>In fact, Thad almost envied him his resolution to
head that way. It seemed the shortest route to
safety in those strenuous days when the whole of
Belgium was ablaze with excitement, hostile armies
battling for supremacy, and every one suspicious of
all strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day will decide the question for us,&rdquo; Allan
was saying, an hour or so after they had started
that morning; &ldquo;if we manage to pull through up
to night time without any more backsets, we can consider
it settled that we&rsquo;re going to make Antwerp
by this route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one disagreed with him. Even Bumpus was
figuring what thirty miles &ldquo;as the crow flies&rdquo; might
mean, when they had to follow varying trails and
roads, subject to the whims of any military commands
they chanced to meet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something coming ahead there!&rdquo; announced the
ever-watchful Giraffe.</p>
<p>On looking the others could see that a cloud of
dust was rising in the direction they were heading.
This of course indicated the passage of some considerable
number of men or horses along the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another battery coming from Antwerp and
hurrying to the front by this route,&rdquo; speculated Allan,
and indeed that seemed the most probable explanation
of the disturbance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I heard what sounded like the clatter of
horses&rsquo; hoofs then,&rdquo; announced Giraffe, with his
hand cupped at his ear to imitate the rabbit, which
a kindly Nature has so constructed as to be able to
throw its ears forward and catch the slightest sound
that otherwise would be inaudible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Thad listened, and as he did so his eyebrows went
up as though a suspicion might be passing through
his mind that Allan&rsquo;s speculation was altogether
wrong.</p>
<p>He too heard the clatter of hoofs now, for they
were coming more heavily. To him it seemed as
though there were many hundreds of them, and that
they pounded the road more like a squadron of cavalry
on the gallop.</p>
<p>Thad drew the car to one side of the road, and
then stopped his engine. Until the mystery had
been solved there was no use trying to proceed further.
Perhaps this spot was to mark the high-water
line of their advance on Antwerp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I can see them beginning to show up
now!&rdquo; cried Giraffe.</p>
<p>Moving figures came into view, constantly augmented
until there must have been scores amidst the
rising dust. No sooner had Thad noticed the fact
that they were gray-coated, and that they carried
what seemed to be lances, with small pennons fluttering
at the ends, than he knew what it meant.</p>
<p>Giraffe voiced what all of them understood by
that time when he ejaculated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re German lancers, don&rsquo;t you see,
boys; the Uhlans we&rsquo;ve heard so much about, the
Rough Riders of the Kaiser, and raiding the country
to cut off communications between the Belgian
army and Brussels. Whew! now we&rsquo;re in the soup!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><span class="small">THE UHLAN HOLD-UP.</span></h2>
<p>Bumpus was heard to give a big sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see our finish, boys,&rdquo; he remarked, calmly,
as though he had resigned himself to the inevitable.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to cry quits, and hold up my hands.
Holland looks pretty good to me just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait and see what happens,&rdquo; said Thad,
though he secretly rejoiced to hear Bumpus admit
this, for the fat scout had more at stake than the
rest of them, in that his sick mother was waiting
and watching in the city of the Schelde.</p>
<p>The Uhlans came swiftly along. If they noticed
the old car drawn to one side of the road, out of the
way, they gave no evidence of the fact until the
leaders had arrived almost abreast of the spot.</p>
<p>Then a bugle sounded, and the whole squadron
halted, causing the dust to mount up more furiously
than ever.</p>
<p>A score of troopers gathered around the car, most
of them officers, Thad could see, although the dust
covered them so completely that it concealed the insignia
of their rank to some extent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giraffe, it&rsquo;s your turn,&rdquo; said Thad to the lanky
scout; &ldquo;air what German you know, and tell them
we&rsquo;re American Boy Scouts; also ask if one of them
can converse with me in English.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need to ask that, because most of us
are familiar with your tongue,&rdquo; said the stout officer
who seemed to be in chief command, much to the
satisfaction of the scouts. &ldquo;But we must take that
assertion of yours with a grain of allowance. We
even suspect that you are English boys, bent on getting
through our lines with valuable information for
the enemy, which we cannot allow, you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad was not surprised. He realized that at such
a time every one who spoke the English language
must come under the ban with the Teuton race.
Already he had discovered that this stout man was
inclined to be a martinet, and possibly ruthless in
dealing with those whom he had reason to suspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you, sir,&rdquo; he hastened to say, respectfully
but firmly, &ldquo;that we are every one of us native-born
Americans. We were making a cruise down
the Rhine and when we arrived at Cologne news
that war had broken out gave us a shock. One of
my comrades here has a sick mother in Antwerp,
under the care of a specialist. That is why we are
trying to make our way there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get this car?&rdquo; asked the officer,
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Cologne, or rather near there, buying it from
a man we met. I have the bill of sale here. It is a
terrible car, and has broken down with us many
times. That is why we were allowed to keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But if, as you say, you were in Germany when
the Kaiser&rsquo;s troops crossed over into Belgium, how
happens it you are here? They would not let you
come by way of Aachen, where the glorious army
crossed the border?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad, of course, did not mean to tell how they
had been hotly chased by German troopers, and just
managed to elude them by reaching the Dutch
guards in time. He fancied that such an account
would hardly be likely to influence this stern looking
Uhlan leader in their favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We figured that there would be all sorts of difficulties
in trying to cross at that point, sir,&rdquo; the boy
explained, simply; &ldquo;and so we arranged to pass over
into Holland where it is very narrow, and from
there reach Belgium. That is what we have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you have been allowed to proceed this far
in peace, it seems?&rdquo; observed the Prussian, as
though he considered this a very significant fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we have had all sorts of troubles besides our
poor car breaking down,&rdquo; Thad continued. &ldquo;Yesterday
from a hilltop we witnessed the fight for a
bridge that was defended by a Belgian battery.
The Germans charged bravely, and would have carried
the bridge, but it had been mined, and was
blown up just as they reached it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Uhlan officers exchanged glances. Thad was
of the impression that possibly they may have been
having a tragic little experience themselves in connection
with the ingenuity shown by the Belgians in
setting traps at bridge-heads. He remembered how
he and his chums had been told by those Belgian
soldiers that they had fixed it so the bridge they
guarded would fall as soon as troopers started to
swing across it, carrying some of them down in
the ruins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>He heard them talking among themselves in German.
Giraffe was listening eagerly to what he could
catch, and when he found a chance he whispered to
Thad what he was able to make of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say a breathing spell for the men will do
no harm, and you can see their horses are sweating
something fierce, Thad. But somehow all you&rsquo;ve
said doesn&rsquo;t seem to have convinced that head officer.
He must hate everything English like the mischief,
for some reason or other. He&rsquo;s telling them
that perhaps we&rsquo;re cunning spies after all, smart
Britishers playing a game, and pretending to be neutral
Americans. I&rsquo;ll keep on listening and see what
they mean to do, Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, now that most of the dust had settled,
Thad found a chance to glance along the line,
and notice what a sturdy, well-set lot those Uhlan
raiders were. As a rule they seemed to be fair-haired
young chaps, with clear eyes and ruddy
cheeks. Thad was more than a little surprised.
Like many others, he had imagined that all Uhlans,
having such a reputation for daring and recklessness,
must be grim-looking men, after the type of
the Russian Cossacks. These fellows were not at
all what he had pictured them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>They sat their saddles like men who were born
to ride hard. And the horses were a picked lot,
capable of standing great fatigue, Thad also noticed.
After all he believed he would always be glad he
had come in contact with these Uhlans; for he had
wanted to see them at close quarters; and on that
other occasion the moonlight did not allow of much
scrutiny.</p>
<p>Presently the chief officer turned again to the boy
in the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me your passports!&rdquo; he commanded, and
if anything his voice and manner were sterner than
before.</p>
<p>Thad was only too glad of the opportunity to do
so. He also gave up the several letters so that the
other could glance them over, which he proceeded to
do. All that time the look of suspicion did not leave
his set face. Every now and then he would eye the
boys keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He just keeps on thinking we&rsquo;re sailing under
false colors, Thad,&rdquo; muttered Giraffe, who had also
observed the actions of the Uhlan commander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take out what letters the rest of you have had
from home since coming over,&rdquo; said Thad, hoping
that this would convince the other, and bring about
their release; for should they be arrested as spies,
and treated harshly, he considered that would be the
hardest blow of all.</p>
<p>Even when he had carelessly glanced at these the
face of the officer still wore that same frown, as
though he could not get rid of his suspicion that
they were really English boys, and all this might
only be a cleverly arranged scheme to hide their
identity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>Thad was almost ready to give up in despair.
He felt that he had about reached the end of his
rope, and could do nothing more. Just how these
hard riders could hold them prisoners, and make
them accompany them he could not guess, unless
they happened to have four empty saddles among
them. And it would be difficult to imagine Bumpus
going at headlong speed across country, keeping
pace with such mad riders as these Uhlans.</p>
<p>Then all at once Thad remembered something.
It was not that a verbal plea would do any good,
for he suspected the more he talked the stronger
would this martinet be inclined to hold them under
the ban of his displeasure.</p>
<p>The brief note written by the aviator whom they
had aided&mdash;might not that be of benefit to their
cause?</p>
<p>It will be remembered that Thad had taken pains
to conceal this under the lining of his campaign
hat, lest some Belgian eye read what the Taube
birdman had written over his signature, and charge
them with being German spies.</p>
<p>Taking off his hat he fumbled under the lining,
and quickly produced the paper, a bit crumpled, and
lacking freshness, but with the penciled writing
plainly legible, which was all Thad cared about.</p>
<p>When he looked up he saw that many eyes had
been following his motions, as if the Uhlans had
had their curiosity aroused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is one incident connected with our trip
through this part of Belgium, sir, that I would like
to speak of, hoping it will convince you we are
what we claim to be, only that and nothing more.
Have I your permission to tell you about this adventure,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; the officer told him; &ldquo;we are giving
the horses a little rest, which they sorely need, so
a short delay will do no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were coming along when we had an accident
to the engine. While I was making the necessary
repairs one of my friends made an astonishing
discovery. We saw the figure of a man caught in
the top of a tall tree. He was moving his arm to us
as if he hoped to attract our attention in that way.
When we hurried up to the tree we found, just as
we expected, the wreck of an aeroplane there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad purposely paused at that thrilling point so
as to let them grasp the full force of his assertion.
He was not much surprised when the officer demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you tell from the build of the aeroplane
what sort of a machine it may have been, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for I had noticed them while over in Germany,
sir,&rdquo; replied Thad. &ldquo;It was a Taube model.
We climbed the tree at once, three of us, and after
some hard work managed to get the aviator safely
down. He told us how he had been scouting over
the Belgian lines when both his machine and himself
were struck by shots. He tried to sail slowly to
the ground miles away from the fighting line, but
by hard luck struck that tree, and became caught
there, his machine falling to the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>Again Thad stopped as though to get his breath,
but it was really done for effect and to give the officer
a chance to ask a question, which he immediately
did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you claim that this man whom you aided
was a German aviator, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had a bad wound in his arm,&rdquo; proceeded the
boy, promptly, &ldquo;which we had no trouble in binding
up, because you may know, sir, that scouts are
taught how to treat all manner of wounds. I am
sure he felt very grateful on account of what little
we were able to do for him. We were only carrying
out the principles of our scout organization.
It did not matter to us whether he was German, Belgian
or French, he was in need of assistance, and
we gave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer in command swept a look around at
his comrades, and Thad saw that several of them
nodded their heads as though they rather liked the
way the boy in khaki had put forward his ideas concerning
strict neutrality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you know the name of this German
Taube operator if you heard it again, boy?&rdquo; asked
the commander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he left a note with us, which he signed with
his name,&rdquo; said Thad, smilingly; &ldquo;you see he said
it might be of assistance to us in case we came across
any party of Uhlans on our travels. I supposed
from that he must be pretty well known, although
of course none of us had ever heard his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it that note you just took from under the
lining of your hat?&rdquo; asked the officer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and here it is. You see, I felt that it
might get us into trouble if Belgian eyes saw it, for
they would not like to know we had saved the life
of a German aviator who would have died in that
tree, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer hastily took the piece of paper and
read the few lines written thereon by the man of
the wrecked Taube. Thad saw that it seemed to
create something of a sensation among the Uhlans
as it was passed from hand to hand, and from this
he felt satisfied that the aviator must have been
one of the leading airmen in the German flying
corps.</p>
<p>Now the grim face of the Uhlan commander had
relaxed. He even smiled on the Scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am convinced that you are what you claim, my
brave boys; so shake hands with me, one and all
of you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><span class="small">TURNED BACK.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Bully,&rdquo; Giraffe was heard to mutter half under
his breath, at this sudden change in front on the
part of the stern Uhlan officer, evidently a soldier
of more or less reputation.</p>
<p>Even Bumpus wanted to be able to say he had
grasped the fist of a German cavalry officer raiding
through Belgium, for he crowded forward, and
was the last to be greeted in that friendly way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me give you back this slip of paper, boy,&rdquo;
said the commander to Thad. &ldquo;You should be very
proud of having saved the life of that brave man,
for he is called the foremost aviator in our entire
corps. If our commander, the Kaiser, ever learns
of what you have done be assured that he will send
you a personal letter of thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this was very pleasant for the boys to hear.
Bumpus was evidently still hugging a faint hope
to his faithful heart that they might be allowed to
pass on. He even managed to find his voice, and
put his anticipation into words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And could we be allowed to keep on to Antwerp,
sir?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>At that the officer frowned again. He seemed
to consider for a moment, then shook his head
slowly in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must turn back, and proceed to the Dutch
border,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;It would be much better
for you to try and reach Antwerp by way of Rotterdam
and the sea. There nothing will delay you,
while on land a thousand obstacles may arise to prevent
the accomplishment of your plans. Besides,
you must give us your word of honor as scouts that
you will not come back this way again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad felt as though a great load had been taken
from his chest. Now that they were to be forced
to promise Bumpus could not complain; and they
would be able to try the other plan. He was sorry
now he had not insisted on doing that at the time
they trod Dutch soil; before now they would have
reached Rotterdam, and might even be sailing for
the Schelde.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are ready to make you that promise, sir,&rdquo; he
told the commander of the Uhlans, &ldquo;in fact, we
should have decided on that course long ago. It
would have saved us a heap of trouble. Once across
the border and on Dutch soil we should not have
crossed back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I differ with you there, boy,&rdquo; said the other,
smiling again; &ldquo;for had you done so the German
flying corps would perhaps have lost its most brilliant
and daring exponent. Turn your car, therefore,
and you can proceed ahead of us. First of all
let me mark out the course I wish you to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he drew out a map of Belgium and
Holland. Thad was interested when he saw what
a marvel of ingenuity that map was. It had evidently
been carefully prepared for the army to be
used in case of just such an invasion. Possibly
there were other charts covering Great Britain,
France, Russia, Italy, Switzerland and Denmark.</p>
<p>Thad saw that it was very minute. Not a railroad,
station, crossing, canal, road, town, village,
bridge, ford, fort or anything else of consequence
but that it was plainly marked there. And the officer
had other maps too, for Thad glimpsed them
when he was selecting this one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>He traced the route back to the Dutch border,
and Thad, taking out his own apology for a chart,
made marks to indicate the course he was to take.
Then after considerable work he managed to get
the car turned, some of the troopers being ordered
to dismount and lend a helping hand. After that
they started, and before they had gone far the clatter
of horses&rsquo; hoofs from the rear announced that
the entire squadron of troopers must be coming
after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! but I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re not meaning us any
harm,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, as he took one of his
usual backward peeps by simply twisting that long
neck of his around; &ldquo;because they&rsquo;d be able to overtake
us in a jiffy, even if their nags are tired. It&rsquo;s
a heap nicer to have these hard-riding Uhlans for
friends than enemies. And I also hope we don&rsquo;t run
afoul of that armored motor-car we saw, with those
reckless Belgians in the same. I do believe they&rsquo;d
charge the whole Uhlan squadron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad himself echoed that wish. He had seen
sights during that terrible battle for the possession
of the disputed bridge that would never fade from
his memory; and he did not want to look on anything
further that had to do with bloodshed and
misery, under the thin veneering of glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming to the side road he wants us to
take, and which will lead to the Dutch border,&rdquo;
Thad announced after a time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>A few minutes later and the car turned to the
left, after which Thad shut down. Standing up
they watched the troop gallop past, and fortunately
the dust was blowing toward the opposite quarter
so their view was not hindered. The scouts had
taken off their hats, and every time they saw any
one in that long column give them a salute they
answered in kind as they had been taught by the
rules of the organization to which they belonged.</p>
<p>Finally the last Uhlan had ridden past, and only
a slowly settling cloud of dust told where they
had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll always remember this last incident as one
of the pleasant episodes of our dash through Belgium,&rdquo;
remarked Thad, as they settled down again
in their places for another start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing sure, Thad,&rdquo; observed Giraffe, &ldquo;that
commander must have placed a lot of confidence in
your simple word, because he wouldn&rsquo;t know now
whether we meant to keep on into Holland, or try
again to push on after he&rsquo;d forbidden it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he knows whatever a scout says he&rsquo;ll
do he tries to perform,&rdquo; ventured Bumpus, proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven miles isn&rsquo;t far, and with any sort of luck
we ought to be over the line by noon,&rdquo; remarked
Allan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan of campaign, then, Thad?&rdquo; inquired
Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try for a station on a railway,&rdquo; he was
told. &ldquo;Over in Holland they&rsquo;re not so apt to be
given over wholly to the military forces, so we
stand a chance to get passage to Rotterdam. The
very first time our car goes back on us with the
railroad close by it&rsquo;s good-bye to this machine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think any of us will mourn much
for the dinky trap,&rdquo; Giraffe argued; &ldquo;but then I
suppose after a time when things get mellow in our
minds well all take a lot of satisfaction in talking
about this trip, and the old car will come in for its
share of attention. Time heals many faults, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that the change in plans had really come
about, they could feel a sort of satisfaction in reflecting
that they had kept on to the very last. In
fact, they had refused to give up until actually in
the hands of the Uhlans, and compelled to promise
on their honor as scouts that they would do as
ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! did you see that?&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpus,
starting them all to staring around in various directions;
and then he condescended to go on, thus
centering their attention to the one point&mdash;&ldquo;it was
ahead of us I saw it, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw what, a boa constrictor from the menagerie?&rdquo;
demanded Giraffe, with the suspicion of a
sneer in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a <i>man</i>,&rdquo; said Bumpus, severely, &ldquo;if you
want to know, and he dodged into the bushes there
as quick as a flash when we came around the bend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he did, eh?&rdquo; continued Giraffe; &ldquo;and now
mebbe you could tell us what sort of a man it was,
Bumpus, white or black, tall or short, soldier or just
a plain ordinary citizen. Speak up, Bumpus, we&rsquo;re
waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked to me about like our friend the
Kaiser!&rdquo; said the fat scout, with a trace of a smile
on his rosy face; &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s where he dodged into
the brush, too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>Thad stopped the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more likely than that it was the very
man,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I should think he might
have gotten this far along the way to the Dutch
border by now,&rdquo; and then raising his voice the patrol
leader called: &ldquo;Hello! Kaiser, don&rsquo;t you want
to buy a dog? Show yourself, Bob; you ought
to know your friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that a lanky figure bobbed up and there was
an inarticulate cry, after which the circus fugitive
hurried to join them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this <i>is</i> a surprise, I must say, and a pleasant
one in the bargain,&rdquo; he declared, fairly bubbling
over with delight as he shook first Thad&rsquo;s hand and
then that of each scout in rotation; &ldquo;I never
dreamed I&rsquo;d see you boys again on this side of the
water. What made you change your minds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stout officer in the uniform of a Uhlan colonel,&rdquo;
laughed Thad. &ldquo;The fact is we ran smack
into a squadron of Uhlans, and they made us promise
to cross over to Holland; so, as scouts always
keep their solemn word we&rsquo;re bound that way right
now. And there&rsquo;s room enough for you to crowd
in, if you think we can make faster time than
afoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tattooed man did not wait for a second invitation,
and easily squeezed in with the two boys
in the rear. There was not much room to spare,
owing to the fact of Bumpus being so very corpulent;
but then Kaiser was as thin as he was long,
so that he occupied very little space. Giraffe said
he &ldquo;wedged&rdquo; himself in, which was about the truth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>He was greatly interested in hearing of the adventure
that had befallen Thad and his three chums
since they separated from him that morning. For
the first time he learned how they had saved that
German Taube man from the treetop, afterwards
binding up his wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does beat all creation,&rdquo; declared the circus
fugitive, &ldquo;how you boys manage to go around doing
good to others. I owe you a big debt just as
that aviator does, and I warrant you there are many
others, only you&rsquo;re too modest to mention the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s all in the game!&rdquo; said Giraffe, making
out to look upon such things with a feeling bordering
on contempt, although being human he must
have liked to hear his praises sung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell the truth,&rdquo; ventured Thad, &ldquo;we are the
ones who feel under obligations, because we get
much more benefit out of these happenings than the
other fellow. Everybody does who believes in the
old saying that it&rsquo;s more blessed to give than to
receive. Besides, we are only obeying the rules of
the organization that we&rsquo;re proud to say we belong
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they went on their way the man who had traveled
to the uttermost corners of the world entertained
them with still further stories connected with
his strange experiences. Thus they hardly noticed
the lapse of time, and when Thad told them they
had passed the seventh mile the eagle eye of Giraffe
began to get busy with the task of locating the guard
station that would mark the border line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>A short time afterwards he pointed it out to them,
and they discovered one of the same white posts
that had marked the division of territory at the time
they were chased by the German cavalrymen, and
found refuge over the line with the soldiers of
Queen Wilhelmina.</p>
<p>Of course they were stopped, but at this early
stage in the war the Dutch guard along the border
had no orders to keep any one out of Holland.
Questions were put to them by an officer who was
summoned by the privates. These of course Thad
could answer truthfully, and besides, the manly
bearing of the lads must have had an influence in
determining the officer to admit the party.</p>
<p>He did look rather doubtfully at the circus freak,
but having been told just who Kaiser was, and
seen something of his wonderful adornment, he did
not think himself justified in turning him back.</p>
<p>So it came the four scouts left Belgium territory
again. They had been through some pretty warm
experiences since first striking the soil of the buffer
state, many of which would never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Somehow all of them seemed to breathe easily
after they had started along the road that would
take them to the nearest railroad town. Thad knew
it had all been a mistake, their trying to break past
the struggling armed hosts, and that they would
have shown wisdom had they come this way in the
beginning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>At the same time he did not feel very sorry.
They had been given a wonderful experience, and
would certainly never forget some of the things
that had happened to them. Particularly would
they have reason to remember that terrible battle
for the bridge head, when the German hosts fought
their way through a storm of shot, only to see the
bridge blown up with dynamite before they could
secure it.</p>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX.
<br /><span class="small">A CHANGE OF PLANS&mdash;CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That finishes it with me,&rdquo; remarked Thad,
when the car came to a sudden stop, on account
of the treacherous motor breaking down again.
&ldquo;Get ready to leave the old trap in the ditch, boys.
We&rsquo;ll give some other simpletons a chance to tinker
with the machine. I&rsquo;m done with it, once and for
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you gave us all plain warning in good
time, Thad,&rdquo; spoke up Giraffe, not in the least depressed
with this change of plans, because his impatient
spirit could not brook these irritating delays.</p>
<p>Even Bumpus did not show any considerable
amount of chagrin, and the reason was quickly made
manifest when he broke out with:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I really believe we must be close on to that railroad
town they called Valkenswaard; because as
sure as anything I heard the sound of a train moving
along just then. Yes, there it goes again, with the
motor puffing like hot cakes. Thad, tell me if I&rsquo;m
right about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what you are, Bumpus,&rdquo; replied the patrol
leader. &ldquo;I heard it myself, which was one reason
I said what I did. We&rsquo;ve been heading nearly
due east for some little time now, and were due to
strike the line of steel before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plan then is to step out lively, and get to
this Dutch town,&rdquo; suggested Allan. &ldquo;I suppose
then we&rsquo;ll take the very first chance we can strike
to start for Rotterdam by way of&mdash;for goodness&rsquo;
sake, let me see that chart of yours again, Thad;
because these terrible Dutch names twist my tongue
so&mdash;here it is, Hertogenbosch, which seems to be
about the biggest railway center in all Holland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far away is Rotterdam, Thad?&rdquo; asked
Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell you exactly, Bumpus,&rdquo; answered
the scout leader; &ldquo;but on a guess I&rsquo;d say not more
than a hundred miles. The Netherlands isn&rsquo;t a
very big country, you remember, and yet one of
the most wonderful places in the world. We&rsquo;ll see
some strange sights as we go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we make the trip by daylight, then,&rdquo; said
Giraffe, who was more or less fond of seeing new
scenes.</p>
<p>They made sure to leave nothing behind that they
cared to keep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, little old trap,&rdquo; said Giraffe, making a
mock bow toward the abandoned car; &ldquo;you played
your part all right in the circus, and we&rsquo;ll often
think of you, with tears in our eyes. All the same
we&rsquo;re glad to be able to say our necks haven&rsquo;t been
broken while we navigated the roads of Germany,
Belgium and Holland in your care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside of half an hour they actually arrived at
the town on the railway. Here they managed to
get something to eat while waiting for a train to
come along. It was by the greatest luck in the
world that they found themselves on the road
shortly after noon, because the service between Belgium
and Holland was already sadly disorganized
on account of what was going on across the border.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the town of Hertogenbosch
they found that they would have to wait an
hour before they could make a fresh start for Rotterdam.
Here Kaiser the tattooed man said good-bye
to his young friends, since he was headed for
Amsterdam, and their routes ran in different directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got your home address, boys,&rdquo; he said after
squeezing their hands for the third and last time,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to drop in and see you some time
or other, if I get out of this country alive. You&rsquo;ve
been good friends to me, and I&rsquo;ll never forget it.
I&rsquo;m a firm admirer of Boy Scouts from this time
on, and will preach the gospel of humanity wherever
I go, just as you&rsquo;ve paid it out to me. Good-bye,
all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>They were really sorry to part with Bob Kaiser,
for if ever there lived an entertaining and good-hearted
eccentric fellow he &ldquo;filled the bill,&rdquo; as
Giraffe said.</p>
<p>During that long afternoon they continued to
pass through a most interesting country, with many
glimpses of watery sections, where the dikes kept
the sea from flooding the rich land which the industrious
Dutch had wrested from the grip of Mother
Ocean.</p>
<p>It seemed as though every rod of it must be
under cultivation, and the boys understood after
that journey what was really meant by &ldquo;intensive
farming.&rdquo; Flowers without number were included
in the various crops, for Holland is the home of
the greatest nursery of bulbs in the whole world,
her rich soil being just suited to their growth.</p>
<p>Evening was drawing on apace when they neared
the great city of Rotterdam and sniffed the salty
scent of the sea that lay beyond. It acted like a
tonic upon the four lads. Even Bumpus was noticed
to take numerous whiffs of the invigorating atmosphere,
although he had been very seasick on the
voyage across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>They managed to get located at a small but neatly
kept hotel, where they could stay while looking
about, and making inquiries concerning the possibilities
of getting to Antwerp by water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>Never in all their lives had they seen such wonderful
cleanliness. The women and children with
their queer head-dresses, and snow-white garments
were a never ceasing source of wonder to the boys,
especially Bumpus, who often chuckled when he
pointed out roly-poly boys who put even his own
generous proportions into the shade, so to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the land where you really belong, Bumpus,&rdquo;
Giraffe told him; &ldquo;here you could pass unnoticed,
if only you dressed like these other boys
do. Just imagine our Bumpus with a pair of those
wide trousers on, and wooden shoes to finish him
off, would you? I&rsquo;ve got half a mind to buy an outfit
for you, Bumpus, while we have the chance.
You&rsquo;d make a great hit with the pretty girls of
Cranford when you came out and set the style for
the rest of the fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squander your money if you feel like it, Giraffe,&rdquo;
Bumpus good-naturedly told him; &ldquo;but getting
me to wear such a clown outfit will be another
thing. One boy c&rsquo;n lead a horse to water, but the
whole Cranford Troop can&rsquo;t make him drink against
his will, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had a peaceful night of it, although at first
they feared the many noises welling up from the
water front where the shipping was so dense would
annoy them. It must have been they were all pretty
tired, and that of late they had failed to enjoy their
customary sound sleep, for to tell the truth none
of them seemed to know a thing from the time they
retired until Thad, arousing, found it was already
broad daylight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>Immediately after breakfast they started out.
Bumpus was becoming distressed once more on account
of his not having heard from his mother for
such a long time. He was exceedingly fond of her,
and felt sure she must be enduring great mental
agony on account of the uncertainty concerning her
boy, marooned up in the Rhine country by this sudden
breaking out of the great war.</p>
<p>At first they did not meet with any luck. Vessels
were starting out that day, a number of them, but
for America and England. Those destined to cross
the Atlantic had every stateroom engaged, for thousands
of sight-seers had already taken the alarm,
and were flocking to the Dutch ports to get passage
home.</p>
<p>It was about the middle of the morning when
Thad struck a clue which seemed to give more or
less hope. Eagerly following the trail they finally
learned that a small steamer expected to leave Rotterdam
for Antwerp an hour after noon that same
day. There might not be another for forty-eight
hours, and so it became necessary for the scouts to
immediately engage passage, and then hurry back to
settle their score at the hotel, as well as carry their
personal belongings aboard.</p>
<p>Being something of hustlers they managed to accomplish
all this in record time, having learned that
they could get dinner on board the boat.</p>
<p>And once comfortably settled they could await
the sailing of the boat with a conviction that their
troubles were in all probability over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just to think,&rdquo; said Giraffe, after they had
started down the river to the sea, lying some twenty
miles or so away, &ldquo;if we could have continued our
voyage in that little boat of ours through the rest
of Germany and then into Holland we&rsquo;d have
brought up here, sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, is this really the mouth of the Rhine?&rdquo;
asked Bumpus, wonderingly; &ldquo;I had an idea Rotterdam
was situated on the Meuse River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a regular mix-up, however you try to
see it,&rdquo; responded Giraffe, who had been studying
the chart, and wished to exploit his knowledge;
&ldquo;there seem to be no end to the outlets of those two
rivers when they get to the delta region of the
Netherlands, and you can call them either the Rhine
or the Meuse as you please. It&rsquo;s all salt water down
here, anyhow, and these are really arms of the
North Sea reaching far up into the Low Countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a very interesting trip down the river, at
any rate. They had glimpses of forts which Holland
had erected in order to defend her cities against
any foreign foe; though the boys considered that
her greatest possible danger lay in the west, where
Germany had an envious eye on this valuable territory
that seemed to properly be a part of her expanding
empire.</p>
<p>Finally about the middle of the afternoon they
came in sight of the sea, though its heaving had
been manifest for some time previously. All of
the scouts viewed the apparently boundless expanse
of salt water with delight; Bumpus however was
heard to express a fervent hope that he would not
have to pass through another attack of sea sickness.
When about an hour before the setting of the sun
they saw heavy smoke along the horizon, and presently
could make out a long line of what appeared
to be misty-colored battleships headed <i>north</i>, it gave
them a decided thrill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They must be a part of the great British fleet, on
the way to seek battle with the Kaiser&rsquo;s warships!&rdquo;
was the consensus of opinion; and having lately
witnessed the ferocity that marks a battle the boys
could easily picture the stirring scene if ever a decisive
conflict did take place between the rival fleets
of the North Sea.</p>
<p>With the good boat forging on toward the mouth
of the Schelde River, up which it would pass to the
docks at Antwerp, it seemed as though the troubles
of Thad Brewster and his three fellow scouts might
be over for the present. They fully anticipated
being in the Belgian city by morning, and possibly
taking passage for London before another night,
with Mrs. Hawtree in their care.</p>
<p>Here we may well leave them, confident that no
matter what may arise to throw obstacles in their
way, these energetic and resourceful lads can be
depended on to overcome all trials, and reach the
haven for which they are heading. At some no
far distant day we can hope to once more follow
their fortunes in new fields of scout endeavor; but
until that time comes we must ring down the curtain
and say good-bye.</p>
